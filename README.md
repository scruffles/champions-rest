## TODO
* TLS
* Google maps of bar locations (maybe use a historic St Louis map?)
* Google maps of fight locations
* finish going over articles for references (stopped at 221)
* go through articles for quotes
* update the format of the Record page to be easier to reference and contain more textural summaries and quotes rather than just stats
* add zoom capabilities to full size articles
* have article text transcribed
* add articles under /articles/to-sort
