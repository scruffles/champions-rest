    text: "On Saturday night, Mike McCoole, \"Champion of America,\" was matched to fight Tom Allen, of England, for one thousand dollars, on the 17th of March. The agreement was signed, the preliminaries arranged, and a forfeit of $150 put up. The whole affair transpired at Loones's, after the sparring at the exhibition on Saturday night. The friends of McCoole were surprised to find him taking a risk so soon before meeting Joe Coburn. A conversation between one of his friends and himself, which transpired yesterday morning, will better explain the whole thing than we can do it. McCoole had just come out of a barber's shop when he was accosted, and the following ensued:\n\nFriend—If you fight Tom Allen, I hope you will get whipped.\n\nMcCoole—Thank you. Take something.\n\nFriend—You can't fight him and get ready for the fight with Coburn. Who knows much about Allen in this country? It is no honor to whip him. Fight the great Tycoon, Coburn, and let this man wait for his time.\n\nMcCoole—I have time to whip two of them, and then train for the Coburn fight.\n\nFriend—But you don’t want to catch all the pigeons in a week; if you do, there will be more to catch.\n\nMcCoole—I intend to catch all the pigeons in one week, and the next I mean to go a-fishing.\n\nAnd McCoole positively refused to withdraw from this fight, which was proposed to take place within 60 miles of St. Louis, a week from tomorrow (March 17). We learn that the thing grew out of a little animosity which sprang up between McCoole and Allen on Saturday night. Had this been true, coupled with the fact that the men would have entered the ring without training, the fight would doubtless have proved a desperate one.\n\nAllen is himself a large, well-built man, and his English friends offered to bet heavily on him. It was intimated to McCoole that he had been sent here expressly to unfit him for the Coburn fight. McCoole laughed and said, \"So much the better; if they want to put up a job on me, let them have it.\"\n\nDuring the whole of the day yesterday, this matter was a subject of general discussion upon the street among certain classes. All sorts of surmises were indulged in, among others the conjecture that the affair was a fraud, gotten up for speculation. This was contradicted by numerous facts. McCoole, so far as his record shows, has never loaned his name to a humbug of any kind. Whenever he has fought, he has fought to whip. Besides, it is positively asserted by those who ought to know, that he has had his \"Irish\" aroused, and that nothing short of drawing the \"ruby\" will satisfy him.\n\nIn the exhibition, Saturday night, the set-to between McCoole and Ryall was pleasing and graceful. They both smiled continually. By mere accident, however, their heads came in contact, and a slight abrasion was made just above McCoole’s left eye. They left the stage on the best of terms. In the wind-up, the set-to between McCoole and Allen was characterized by a determination and earnestness seldom witnessed in a friendly contest. The abrasion on McCoole’s forehead was opened afresh, and he bled profusely. The friends of the other party also assert that he bled at the nose, but this is denied. A voice from the audience cried “Stop!” They both threw their gloves upon the stage, and, without ceremony, which is customary, retired. This covers the case as nearly as it can well be done.\n\nRyall and Allen are both unknown here. They have been in the city but a few weeks. Yet we hear English-American citizens speak vauntingly of what Allen has accomplished in the old country. This, no doubt, intensified McCoole's desire to meet him.\n\nThe excitement continued all day, and delegations of McCoole’s friends were constantly waiting on him. At last, he yielded to their wishes, upon the assurance that he was submitting them to a risk as well as himself, as they had money staked upon him. A card in another part of this paper explains his position. He is willing to fight Allen for $2,500 ninety days after his match with Coburn and is ready to put up $500 as a forfeit. Nothing can be more definite than his proposition.\n\nThe exhibition on Saturday night, in which many engaged, was a complimentary testimonial to Ryall and Allen, and was well attended. McCoole volunteered and appeared twice during the evening, which he rarely does for his best friends."

    text: "Whether as an indication of declining morality, or of increasing importance, we will not seek to determine, but certain it is St. Louis is becoming a prominent center for the \"fancy,\" and at present there are a number of well-known representatives of the P. R. within its limits, and the grand object of interest is the approaching contest between Bill Davis, of California, and Tom Allen, of Cleveland. Both pugilists have ardent backers, who are willing to risk odds on the success of their pet man.\n\nAs some of our readers are anxious to know how the arrangements stand on the Davis-Allen fight, we give the articles of agreement.\n\nArticles of agreement entered into, this 4th day of December, 1865, between William M. Davis and Thomas Allen. The said Wm. M. Davis agrees to fight Thos. Allen according to the new rules of the English Prize Ring, by which the said Wm. M. Davis and Thomas Allen hereby mutually agree to be bound. The said fight shall be for the sum of $1,600 and shall take place on Tuesday, the 12th of January, at a greater distance than 40 and not exceeding 60 miles from St. Louis, a place of fighting to be named by the stakeholder, in pursuance of this agreement. $300 a side are placed in the hands of Mr. John Looney, on behalf of Mr. William Davis, and the last named deposit shall be the final holder. The second deposit of $200 a side shall be at the house of Mr. William Ryall, 417 Washington Avenue, St. Louis, on Friday, the 15th day of December instant. And the third and final deposit of $500 a side shall be made at the house of Mr. Mike McCoole, St. Louis, on Monday, the 4th day of January next. The said deposits shall be made between the hours of eight and ten o'clock in the evening, into the hands of the stakeholder or his representative, and the party failing shall forfeit the money down. The men shall be in the ring between the hours of 7 o'clock A. M. and 12 o'clock M., or the man absent shall forfeit the battle money. That in the event of police interference, the stakeholder shall decide the next time and place of meeting, if possible, the same day. That the expenses of the ropes and stakes shall be borne mutually—share and share alike. The stakes not to be given up unless by consent, until finally won or lost by a fight. The referee to be chosen on the ground, mutually by the said Wm. M. Davis and Thos. Allen, but in case they cannot agree, the stakeholder shall name a referee, whose decision shall be final.\n\nThe net proceeds of the excursion to the fight to be equally divided between the pugilists.\n\nIn pursuance of this agreement we hereunto subscribe our names. WM. M. DAVIS.\n\nWAL RYALL, On behalf of Thomas Allen, Witnesses—WH. B. PENDERGAST, HENRY SLADE.\n\nTom Allen is doing good work to get into condition for the coming struggle. His field of operations is in the neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nBill Davis is out at the Fair Grounds, under the charge of “Dublin Tricks,” drinking nothing, eating little, and exercising much.\n\nAnother pugilistic star has appeared on this horizon in the person of Chas. Convy Gallagher, of Cleveland, Ohio, and a warm friend of Tom Allen. He weighs 210 pounds, is over six feet high, and is only 23 years of age. He was born in Canada, and is well known in the sporting annals of this country. He beat Dick Lowe, in Harper’s Ferry, Va., in 1862; beat Charlie McCarthy, near Cleveland, in 1864; fought Bill Davis, in Canada, on October 5, 1867, and beat Jim Elliott, in four rounds, on November 12, 1868.\n\nHe gives a sparring exhibition on Saturday, the 26th, at the request of the sporting fraternity, who desire to see some touches of his “science” in St. Louis.\n\nThe adjourned exhibition for the benefit of Mike Traynor, of New York, is decided upon to come off in Jack Looney's Hall, on tomorrow night. Traynor is known as one of the trainers of Mike McCoole, in the McCoole and Coburn fight. He has been in ill health lately, and the boys are preparing to give him a good program and a big house.\n\nJames Halloran, of Cleveland, another fistic notoriety, is in town, and hangs out his shingle at Bill Ryall’s, and will pass by no chance to exhibit his superior pugilism.\n\nAs seen by the articles of agreement on the Davis-Allen contest, the second deposit of stakes, $200, is to be made between 8 and 10 this evening, at Bill Ryall’s, on Washington Avenue.\n\nAnother great topic on the sporting carpet is a champion dog fight, to come off at Jack Looney’s New Academy Hall, on the 28th, for $100 a side. The contestants are Joe Callaghan’s dog, “Juarez,” and George Fetchell’s Boston dog, “Maximilian.” Bets run high on both canines."

    text: "The national \"mill\" for the pugilistic championship between Bill Davis, of St. Louis, and Tom Allen, of California, to come off on the 12th of January, is exciting a vast amount of attention in that curious world which revolves around the prize ring. As the day approaches, the feeling deepens into a passionate rivalry between the adherents of the contestants, until on one side it would seem they would even dare the guilt of murder to save the money which has been staked on the result, as whoever fails to appear on the ground will lose the match. No wonder good people raise their hands in holy horror at prize-fighting and exclaim, “Can such things be” in a Christian country. It is very sad indeed, but such things do exist, and will be to the end of the chapter, so far as present appearances go. The following particulars afford an illustration:\n\nOn Christmas day, some friends of Allen and several friends of Bill Davis went out to the Fair Grounds to see Bill in training under the manipulation of “Dublin Tricks.” Efforts are reported to have been made to bribe “Dublin Tricks” to break down Davis, but, as usual, Bill Blake is unbribable. But as nothing could be done in that direction, another dodge was tried more desperate in character. Seven or eight rowdies, said to be backers of Allen, determined to render Davis powerless. So, on Christmas night, at Doyle's, near the Fair Grounds, Davis’ headquarters in training, after a jolly time, one of the fellows picked up a quarrel. Davis, who is being well trained, slammed them right and left, and was about leaving, when one of the party drew a carving knife 15 inches long, and failing to plunge it into the heart of Bill Davis, cut him on the wrist. But Bill will try to get over it and be able to meet Allen on the day and at the time appointed. The trick was a small one, and as disgraceful to those who originated it as to the rowdies who attempted to carry out the idea practically.\n\nThere was an on dit among the sporting fraternity yesterday, that some of the officers went out to the fair grounds to arrest Bill Davis, who is to fight Tom Allen in a few days, and that Bill evaded the magisterial clutches. It is either on a warrant on account of the late melee, in which he came so near being cut to pieces, or some plan to get him into trouble, so as to prevent his “coming to time\" at the expected encounter. Bill spends a good deal of his time among dumb-bells, clubs, sand-bags, boxing-gloves, rings, and a museum of training paraphernalia. He walks a good deal, and is said to have reduced 26 pounds since he went into training.\n\nMichael Ryan, one of the young men who had a difficulty with Bill Davis the other day at the fair grounds, got one of his cheek-bones so badly dislocated, that we learn his life is considered in danger.\n\nAfter two hours’ fighting on Saturday night, Gov. Fletcher's dog, Maximilian, was declared the victor, and considerable money changed hands on the matter."

    text: "Up to this, the excitement has been constantly increasing in reference to the great prize fight to come off on Tuesday next, at a point some 40 or 50 miles from the city, between Wm. M. Davis, of California, and Thomas Allen, of Cleveland, for $1,000 a side. The men have been in active training for some time past. Bill Davis has been out at Pat Doyle's “Crescent City Exchange” at the Fair Grounds, undergoing a rigid system of training under the manipulation of Bill Blake alias “Dublin Tricks.” The late assault on him and the injuries received therefrom do not militate against his fighting status. It was rumored, it was a plot of the enemy to disable him, and render him unfit for the contest. Other rumors were afloat in regard to the matter, which even went to the ears of the New York Clipper, to whom Bill gives this version of the story:\n\n\"Please to allow me to in your columns open before the public, by giving a correct account of the affray in which I was engaged on Christmas day. I had just finished my dinner and was ready for my afternoon walk, when a man I had never seen in my life struck me a blow from behind, on the kidneys. I dodged back and escaped, as he fell, and, in the heat of passion, I kicked him once. After bringing him up and washing him, he came to me, saying it was all a mistake. I told him I did not know him, and it must be a job; but, as a matter of course, I excused him, and so the matter ended for the time. I went out for my walk with Bill Blake, alias “Dublin Tricks,” my trainer, and when I returned the man whom I had the difficulty with was still in the bar room, with five or six others, all armed, and who had shown their weapons to the proprietor of the house, Mr. Doyle, threatening to kill me on sight. Mr. Doyle and others paid no attention to their threats, thinking they were made in drunken brag. When I came in the man whom I had the difficulty with kept a sharp lookout. He tried to drag me to him as we shook hands, when a smaller man stepped between us, and, without a word, made a plunge at my stomach with a knife thirteen or fourteen inches long. I jumped back and struck the big fellow and the little one almost simultaneously, with my walking stick, knocking them down. Almost at the same moment another man struck at me sideways, and, as luck would have it, I saw the blow quick enough to ward it off, but in doing so cut my wrist slightly. I was taken so much by surprise by the onslaught, that I got into a passion and ran upstairs to arm myself. When I was fixed, the proprietor of the house, with several others, had the doors closed, so I could not get in, otherwise the damage might have been serious.\"\n\nYours, respectfully, WM. M. DAVIS.\n\nAt all events, Bill is now over his injuries, in good trim, and confident of an easy victory. He is now down to 175 pounds, fighting weight, having exhausted 25 pounds of his condition in the course of training. He has been declared by excellent “manly artists” to be in the best fighting trim he has ever been in. His backers are alive to his condition, and are betting tall odds upon him.\n\nTom Allen's arrival was announced a few days ago. He went out on the Gravois road, some nine miles from the city, in training, under the management of Tom Kelly, a manipulator of no mean repute. Allen is rather fleshy, but a hard course of training is fast bringing him into proper fighting trim. His friends, and they are many, go out almost daily to witness him among his sand-bags and dumb-bells. They speak very confidently of Allen's ability to “punish” Davis in the coming contest, and are betting liberally on him.\n\nMike McCoole and Bill Ryall, the big-guns of the prize ring, have, we understand, chartered the steamer “Tom Stevens,” to take the pugilists and their friends to the field of battle. We learn that there is a second boat chartered outside of the party to speculate on excursionists to the scene of the encounter.\n\nThe tickets for the fight are already issued at $5 each, and are, in sporting parlance, “going off like hotcakes.” They are to be had only at Mike McCoole’s and Bill Ryall's. The party will leave before 7 o'clock Tuesday morning, when the scene, referee, seconds and other P. R. officials will be chosen. It is emphatically announced that no person will be allowed on board with weapons of any description. A thorough search will be made, and not even a pocket knife will be permitted.\n\nThe inner ring, to which the contestants alone are allowed, will be twenty-four feet square. The middle ring will be under charge of Frank Curry, and will be allotted to the seconds, the referee, the members of the press and those of the attendants who have no objection to pay $2 more for the privilege. The third and outer ring is for the general spectators. It is reported there will be a good band of music in attendance.\n\nAmong the constellation of champion fighters in the city are the following stars: Mike McCoole and Bill Ryall, Tom Riley and Young Ryan, Jack Looney and Tom Kehoe, Bill Davis, of California, and Tom Allen, of Cleveland; Charlie Gallagher the “Cleveland Boy,” and Jim Elliott, of Detroit; “Buffalo Bill,” alias Hanley; Mike Ryan, of Cleveland; Barney Frayne, of Kentucky; Tim Halloran, of Cleveland; Tom Kelley, Allen's trainer; Ed Seward, the “Cleveland Pet;” Tom McAlpine, alias “Soap;” Mike and Jerry Donovan, of Chicago, and a host of others.\n\nSome time ago Chas. C. Gallagher and Jim Elliott had a prize-fight on Peach Island, near Detroit, when most foul play was shown to Gallagher and Elliott's friends claimed the fight. This gave rise to a spirited controversy in the New York Clipper, which called out Gallagher in his own defense, who says he is not a beaten man, and renews his challenge for $2,000 a side and sends to the editor of the Clipper $50 to prove that he meant “biz.” He is now willing to fight Jim Elliott for any amount from five cents to $2,000 and not ask a day’s preparation. Goaded by this offer, we understand, although there are two St. Louis injunctions against Jim, that he reached the city on Friday evening and is under cover, undergoing a thorough system of training, to meet Gallagher in the Davis-Allen ring and “pony up” $500 for his side. On account of Elliott’s peculiar relations to this city, the thing is being done up very quietly and considerable money is being staked on the result. Rumor has it that he makes Rothschild’s Sportsman’s Hall his headquarters. The English prize-ring book, with the heights, weights and fights of every pugilist in the world is to be found there.\n\nIt is understood among the sporting fraternity that a light-weight fight is also to come off in the Davis-Allen ring on Tuesday, between Geo. Looney and Jimmy Adams, each about 110 pounds, for $250 aside. Adams is backed up by Charlie Brownfield, of corner of Fourth and Green streets, and Looney by Tom Kehoe, one of the sports in the crowd.\n\nTuesday evening will conclude with a sparring exhibition in the Green street Academy of Music, for the benefit of Mike Ryan, of Cleveland. All the great fighters in town have promised to appear, and Tony Benton will give some of his comic songs to enliven the scene."

    text: "From an early hour yesterday, in fact, all the night before, the principal sporting depots in town were filled with lovers of the \"manly art,\" speculating on the coming fight between Wm. M. Davis, of California, and Tom Allen, of Cleveland. Betting was not very brisk, the odds being nearly all in favor of Tom Allen. Songs, jokes, and toasts to the \"winning man\" and the \"best man\" were improvised for the occasion in the various houses frequented by the \"fancy.\" Even the softer sex got somewhat enthusiastic over the fight and the prospects of its results. They were ambitious to see the prowess of the ancient gladiators emulated by the \"scientific\" pugilists of modern days. All the houses in the city, peculiarly dedicated to the god of sport, were during the night crowded to overflowing.\n\nFrom an early hour in the morning, or rather for the most part of the night, not only were the saloons, but the boat \"Henry Adkins,\" a scene of peculiar liveliness. Towards daylight, a portion of the Levee was crowded with spectators, who, if they didn't come to see the fight, came to see who did. It was a delightful morning. The sun rose in majestic splendor on the broad waters of the Mississippi, as the Henry Adkins' shrill whistle sounded the signal for starting.\n\nStreams of men began to pour onto the boat, as she lay at the foot of Green Street, from an early hour. Another notable item was the procession of kegs of beer, cases of soda, pyramids of sandwiches, suspicious-looking demijohns, boxes of cigars, and other creature comforts, under the command of F. H. Connallin and Tom Kehoe. It showed that the inner man was not to be neglected, although many appeared with unkempt hair, unwashed faces, and clothes unbrushed. But the early hour was an excuse for all that.\n\nWm. M. Davis, one of the heroes of the occasion, was on board the boat from 3 o'clock, and soundly sleeping in one of the bunks, after a course of hard training. On his appearance on the boat, he looked as if he were the victim of three months’ hard sickness instead of a few weeks’ training. It would appear that his trainer over-reached the mark and debilitated him rather than increased his strength. Still, Bill felt confident of an easy victory.\n\nWm. M. Davis was born in the town of Belfast, in the north of Ireland, in the year 1832. He took a peculiar fancy to the \"manly art\" at an early age and was renowned even in his young days for feats of agility and \"science.\" He is over six feet high and has appeared in the ring several times; eight times of which he fought for a prize. He beat Jake Smith, Pearson, Tom Daly, and Charlie Gallagher, and was forced to lower his standard to Jim Dunn, Mike McCoole, and Jim Elliott. Bill Davis is an \"artist\" of no mean ability, and if his \"science\" were in keeping with his intentions, and his strength not too far extended, he might be able to thrash the best man that could come in his way. As it was, he is somewhat deficient in \"science\" and not very remarkable for strength.\n\nTom Allen, who is by far the stouter though not the heavier man of the two, carries a fighting weight of 163 pounds. He is a native of Birmingham, England, is aged about 28 years, and measures 5 feet 9½ inches. He is an old acquaintance of the prize ring, and in his brief career has had many sharp encounters. He beat Symonds, Clarke, Wight, Young Gould, and Binge Rose, for £25 a side, at 10 stone, in ten rounds, in 29 minutes. In the \"Home Circle\" in 1866, he beat J. Perkinson for twenty-two pounds sterling a side, at 10 stone, 10 pounds, in 11 rounds and 22 minutes. The \"Darlings\" interfered, but Allen claimed and got the stakes. He beat Posh Price for a like amount, in 41 rounds in 2 hours and 5 minutes, on November 28, 1865, when Price was arrested and Allen claimed and took the stakes. He beat George Lees at catch weight for £25 a side in 17 rounds in 62 minutes, on June 13, 1868. He had a \"draw\" with Joe Goss for £100 a side on March 5, 1867, after 34 rounds in 1 hour and 53 minutes. He was beaten by Bob Smith in a match for £5 a side in 60 rounds, in 2 hours and 49 minutes. On June 2, 1864, he was beaten by Posh Price. He came to this country in July, 1867, and for some time past made Cleveland his home. His friends were quite jubilant on his prospects and offered to bet considerable odds on his success.\n\nThe arrangements were completed in every particular, not a pin seemed to have been forgotten, and, after taking on a few at the foot of Walnut Street, the Henry Adkins steamed up to the foot of Green Street, where a large throng awaited her arrival. The necessity of tendering tickets at the gangway kept back a good many, and except a few bantering remarks among the occupants of the boat, little transpired to enliven the monotony of the morning.\n\nA man on board had some words the evening before with another about a woman, and they seemed bent on a fight over the gunwale of the boat. The man aboard was challenged ashore, and, going off the boat, he and his antagonist adjourned to have a drink. Another little \"muss\" occurred between the detective and the gangway police. Atkins arrested one of them, but the crowd gathered so that his escape was effected.\n\nIt was a lively sight, on such a splendid morning—a morning that the most ambitious pugilist, if it were in his power, would have manufactured for the display of his pet science—to see the boat steaming up the river. She slipped anchor at half-past 10 o'clock, and then the party aboard had to amuse themselves as best they might.\n\nAmong the prize ring and pugilists on board were Mike McCoole, Bill Ryall, Jack and George Thompson, Seward, Charlie C., the \"Cleveland Pet,\" Jim Halloran, Billy Carroll, Redmond St. Clair, E. A. Carroll, Barney Frayne, F. H. Connallin, Tom Riley, Tom Wall, Pat Hawley, Patsy Currin, Billy Smith, Johnny Smith, Bill Davis, Tom Kelly, Jack Howard, J. W. Rothschild, \"Dublin Tricks\" and about four hundred others whose names it would be impossible to get. Few of the representatives of the outside press were on hand, although good accommodations were made for the reportorial fraternity by Frank Curry, the manager of the ring. Among the curiosities aboard was a newsboy from Cincinnati on the way from home to see the mill.\n\nCigars, beer, sandwiches, and something harder were distributed mighty liberally; and to extract the spare change from the pockets of the reckless, some half a dozen gaming stands were instituted. Among them were \"high ball\" and \"chuck-a-luck.\" \"High ball\" is played by cups from marked balls in a wicker-work basket, and whoever takes the marked ball draws the stakes deposited. In \"chuck-a-luck,\" six cards, numbering one to six spots, are spread out, and three dice are cast, and the betting on the turning up spots is declared the winner.\n\nThe more staid passengers, and those who cared not to get into the whirl of excitement on board, sat around a pretty warm stove in the end of the boat, and puffed their cigars.\n\nAs the boat steamed up the river, many were the conjectures hazarded as to the time, place, and result of the coming contest. Bill Davis was ensconced in room No. 12 with his trainer and a few choice friends; and nobody else was permitted to invade."

    text: "Yesterday, amid the snow and chilly breezes of the morning, the lovers of pugilism turned out in considerable force for attendance at the fight to take place between Charles C. Gallagher and Thomas Allen, both of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe men and their condition and position have already been described in these columns. Charlie Gallagher is a mere boy of 23 years of age, 6 feet 1 inch in height, and a comparative novice in the prize-ring. Tom Allen is about 30 years of age, 5 feet 10 inches in height, and claims to be the English champion of the prize-ring.\n\nAt nine o'clock, at the foot of Washington Avenue, the “Gem” was receiving passengers for an excursion trip to the scene of battle. Within a square or two, the “Galatea” was receiving the friends and backers of Tom Allen, and seemed to run in opposition to the “Gem.” The “Gem” was specially crowded with the lovers of the “manly art.” The “Galatea” had a very small and, no doubt, select cargo.\n\nAmong the notabilities of the sporting fraternity present were the following, whose names we give for the enlightenment of posterity: Mike McCoole, John Lyoney, Tom Kehoe, J. Hickey, Patsey Curtin, Dan Stevens, Pat Wall, Pete Brooks, Pat Hanlon, Mike Ryan, Geo. Looney, Tim Halloran, Ike Campbell, Chas. E. Dobson, Frank Curry, E. Duffy, Fred Watkins, Tom Curtis, Edwin O'Donnell, of Chicago; James Healy, John Phillips, of Binghamton, New York; Billy Carroll, Jim Shannon, Sherman Thurston, Dad Kvan, Bob Collins, Dave Hoye, Pat Connallin, Young Dago, Pat Reardon, Young Clifford, Phila.; R. B. Baker, Cin.; Frank Roche, Cin.; Tom Ryan, Cin.; Joe Ferry, Cin.; Barney Frain, Covington, Ky.; and many other lesser lights.\n\nIt was about 10 o'clock when the Gem, with her “precious” cargo, toddled up the stream to Bissell’s Point, where the Galatea took Tom Allen on board, to the sound of some shouting. The boats then wound their way down the stream, for the scene of action. McCoole and a few others left the boat at Bissell's Point, in what many on board would call “disgust.” The boat remained at the “Point” a long time, and, at an adjacent store, the boys helped themselves to beer, crackers, cheese, and a variety of other creature comforts, on which the proprietor made slim profits.\n\nOn board the boat were a variety of games of chance—called chuck-luck, red-and-black, seven-up, dice and five or six others that are known only to the initiated.\n\nIt would be a rich subject for a novelist or a philosopher to study the crowd gathered on the lazy boards of the “Gem.” There were fighters from all parts of the continent, and persons of all classes of society. A motley throng animated by the spirit of the barbaric amusement in prospect.\n\nAt Carondelet the “Gem” took Charlie Gallagher on board, and he was cordially received by his friends.\n\nThe project was to go down the river to some spot offering a suitable scene for the contest. Carroll’s Island was selected as the scene of the encounter. It is situated about one mile below Quarantine, and is well wooded, and enlivened by a few shanties and log cabins.\n\nOn this island, in a clearing in the woods, a ring was improvised, according to the regulations of the British prize-ring. The ground was a little uneven and had to be leveled. The snow lay thick and heavy all around, but the genial sun shone out as brightly as if on a camp meeting.\n\nTom Allen chose for his umpire Dan Ryan. Charlie Gallagher chose for his Jimmie McDonnell; but the great difficulty was the selection of a referee.\n\nCharlie Gallagher was the first in the ring, and shied his castor to intimate that he was “on hand.” Soon after Tom Allen arrived, and the fightists were comfortably wrapped in blankets. Both of them looked fresh, physically and mentally.\n\nAfter a hundred names were proposed and discussed for referee it was—at or near 5 P. M.—agreed that Messrs. Kearney and Judd should act in the capacity.\n\nCharlie Gallagher flourished a “C” that Allen promptly took up, and then Allen tried to bluff the friends of Gallagher by offering $100 even, 100 to 90, 100 to 80, and he hallooed very loudly for 100 to 70, which was ultimately returned to Mr. Walker, the treasurer for the occasion.\n\nOn a “toss up” for a choice of corners, Gallagher happened to be the lucky man, and turned his back to the setting sun. The fighters were ready—only to divest them of their toggery and prepare for the inner ring. The ring was neatly prepared, the arrangements being conducted by the following committee: Frank Curry, Barney Frayne, Mike Sullivan, Wm. Fitzgibbons, Tom Riley, Pat Hanley, Pat Reilly, the “dead boxer,” Bob Collins, Jim Halloran, Ed. Robinson, Josh Shaw, Billy Dago, Mike Ryan, Jim Shannon, Denny Daniels, Jim Kearney Hennessy, Pat Rowen, and others.\n\nFrank Curry deserves credit for instituting the practice of providing seats for the reporters in the “inner ring.” Yesterday they were provided with chairs, and everything done to facilitate their operations.\n\nPatsy Reardon and Jack Looney were the seconds of Tom Allen; Patsy Curtin and “Dublin Tricks” manipulated Charlie Gallagher. Pete Brooks acted as ring-master.\n\nIt was nearly five o'clock when the referees were chosen, and the “men” declared themselves ready for the “fun.”\n\nRound 1—Betting ran high and seemed to be in favor of Allen, who looked confident of an easy victory. The men came to the call of “time” with much determination. Gallagher was more cool than we could imagine he would be. Allen had a gay sardonic smile on his handsome English phiz as he measured his opponent. They played around a little, and a right-hander from Gallagher drew first blood from Allen’s upper lip. Soon after a clincher from Allen's right mauler sent the ruby flowing from Gallagher's proboscis. There were several “handsome” right and left thrusts on both sides, and a clip from Allen, aided by a slip, brought Gallagher to the surface of the earth. First knockdown claimed for Allen.\n\nRound 2 and last—The men came to the call of time with great promptitude. Allen dealt Gallagher a tip on the nozzle that sent the carmine over Gallagher’s frontispiece and inspired him to exert himself. Then Gallagher, quick as lightning, gave Allen a left-hander on the chest, and, as Allen dodged his head, a right-hander behind the ear that knocked the champion senseless beyond the ropes. His head lay outside the ring, and the first impression was that Allen was killed. He had to be carried to his corner, and was completely knocked out of time and tune. Restoratives had to be applied with some energy in order to restore him, and his greatest opponents were glad to see signs of returning life.\n\nThis ended the fight, and Charlie Gallagher was declared the victor, and his chosen color, the green, was flaunted amid deafening cheers.\n\nAfter Tom Allen's revival there was some talk of his rechallenging Gallagher for $5,000 a side, but nothing definite transpired.\n\nThe trip home was very animated—discussing the merits of the fight and C. A. Donaldson's refreshments, which the party did with much enthusiasm.\n\nThere is no doubt but the sporting fraternity were much surprised at the issue of the fight. All expected Allen to be the victor, but the blow which might be called a “chance” blow, and might not recur in a hundred fights sent Allen out of time, and almost out of the world. Allen is a man of firmly knit frame, while Gallagher is what may be considered a mere boy as yet, and certainly not Allen's equal in strength."

    text: "After the fighting party returned on Tuesday night, full of excitement from the brief contest of the day, they gathered into McCoole’s opposite the Court-House. Many and copious were the bowls quaffed in honor of the fight. Loud talking and considerable braggadocio were a good deal the order of the time. The contestant of the day, Tom Allen, recovered from the prostrating blow that knocked him out of time, was there. So was Charlie Gallagher—but under the enthusiasm of his victory a little “on the beer.” Charlie talked rather tall and offered to bet Allen an “X” that he dared not reiterate the expression that he was a “cur;” that he would renew the fight then and there. Allen said he was no bar-room fighter, but he would re-meet him in the ring in a week to a month, for $1,000 to $5,000. Words ran high, and Charlie Gallagher seemed disposed with a few of his friends to clean out the McCoole establishment as he did the “champion of England.” One man offered to lay $3,000 that Charlie Gallagher was not the “best man in America,” and as nobody took up the “document” he threw it across the bar into McCoole’s drawer. The excitement was kept up and several of Gallagher’s backers seemed “spoiling for a fight.” After a little spell of loud talking, a nudge from Gallagher commenced operations and a general “rough and tumble” ensued. Several sockdologers were administered. McCoole’s bar-keeper got one behind the ear from Gallagher that sent him to grass. Joe Connallin got “one” over the peeper from a friend of Gallagher's, and returning it with interest compelled his antagonist to cry “quarter.” Things assumed a very bellicose aspect, when McCoole, who had been taking a quiet snooze in the second story, heard the rumpus. He came down, and failing to impress Charlie Gallagher with the idea that he wanted and meant to keep an orderly house, he expelled the victor of England’s champion with a celerity that astonished him. The house was soon cleared, and peace reigned in the castle of the McCoole.\n\nIn all the houses dedicated to the “fancy” the merits and demerits of the fight were freely discussed and criticized. Last night at Hennessy’s, on Fourth street, near Morgan, where the stakes were to be handed over, a dispute arose between Jack Looney and Charlie Gallagher about the referees’ fees, as to whether or not they were in accordance with the rules of the prize ring. Gallagher maintained that his referee should be paid from the general fund, while Jack Looney asserted that Charlie ought to foot the bill. Jack Looney then quoted the following rule of the ring:\n\n4. That two umpires shall be chosen by the seconds or backers, to watch the progress of the battle, and take note of any breach of the rules hereafter stated. That a referee shall be chosen by the umpires, unless otherwise agreed on, to whom all disputes shall be referred; and that the decision of this referee, whatever it may be, shall be final, and strictly binding on all parties, whether as to the matter in dispute or in the issue of the battle. That this official shall receive out of the stakes the sum of 5 percent for officiating, such sum to be deducted by the stakeholder either from the amount of the winnings in case of a win, or in equitable manner from each stake in the event of a draw. No payment to be made in case of a forfeit, or of the referee not being called upon to act. That the umpires shall be provided with a watch for the purpose of calling time and that they mutually agree upon which this duty shall devolve, the call of that umpire only to be attended to, and no other person whatever, except the referee when appealed to, shall interfere in calling time. That the referee shall withhold all opinions until appealed to by the umpires, and that the umpires strictly abide by his decision without dispute.\n\nCharlie didn’t seem inclined to bet, and personalities foreign to politeness ensued, and it seemed likely pistols would be drawn. There was some confusion, amid which Looney could be heard to offer $1,500 to $1,200 that Allen can whip Gallagher in another tussle.\n\nAt Bill Ryan’s the scene was no less exciting, but Bill himself was not there. He is in the Sister's Hospital very low with typhoid fever. His case is considered rather precarious.\n\nThe prospect is, after calmness is restored, we shall have another mill between Allen and Gallagher."

    text: "At a late hour last night, one of our reporters made the round of the various temples of Bacchus, especially dedicated to that branch of the modern Olympian games known as prize fighting, hoping to obtain some items of sporting intelligence, which might appease the appetite of the hungry public until the result of “the strawberry festival” is known.\n\nThe first call was at a saloon on Fifth street opposite the Court House. The crowd here was not unusually large, though Capt. Tom Kehoe, the clever bar-keeper, had his hands full of business in serving out liquid refreshments to the thirsty admirers of the twenty-four foot ring. No one apparently had imbibed too freely, and consequently the best of order prevailed, although now and then some enthusiastic friend of the redoubtable Mike would give vent to a triumphant shout and announce a determination to “go his pile” on the champion. We saw nothing that looked like business except a short, thick-set, red-faced little fellow with a keen eye and a black moustache, who offered to bet one thousand dollars to seven hundred that McCoole would whip Allen in exactly seven minutes and a half.\n\nThere were no takers, so all hands “took a drink round,” and prophesied a lovely day and a lively “mill.”\n\nTom Allen's Concert Saloon on Fifth street, between O'Fallon and Biddle, was comfortably—almost uncomfortably full, it being what is called a “Free and Easy” night. The apartment in the rear of the bar is dedicated to music and luxury—the former being represented by a rattling piano, and the latter by tete-a-tete tables and armchairs, where men can drink beer or suck cobblers, and at the same time cultivate a taste for the opera. Most of the guests, we observed, were Englishmen, and, whatever they may have thought about the approaching fight, they certainly said very little. Over moderate glasses of “'alf and 'alf,” they doubtless drank success to the representative of the British lion, and hoped Old England's hereditary enemy might get a hearty pounding.\n\nOver the array of decanters and lemons, high up among the fly traps of the ceiling, hung a good photograph of Allen, which showed him to be the owner of a face much too handsome to be pounded into a pugilistic jelly. The original of the picture was absent, but unforgotten—“though lost to sight, to memory dear.” In plain words, Allen is supposed to be at the present writing in Venice, waiting for a steam gondola to carry him to a scene of war such as the Doges never dreamed of. Wishing him luck, we stepped around into Broadway, and looked into Charley Gallagher's.\n\nCharley, like the late lamented author of Don Juan, “awoke one morning to find himself famous.” After the manner of a great many, he made a great blow, and profited thereby. He faced Tom Allen under the left ear, a tap which came very near disjointing that gentleman's spinal column, knocking him out of time, and knocking Gallagher into a very good business. He was going around last night as lively as a kitten, fed beer by the small and large, and occasionally doing a double shuffle to the sound of a villainous combination of piano, cornet, and fiddle, which lent sweet harmonies to the patrons of the establishment. Gallagher has a cheerful phiz with no special malice in it, but not what we should call a “fighting face.” Here the preponderance of guests of Celtic origin was apparent, but there was no excitement, and we did not hear the battle spoken of. Whether they consider the result a foregone conclusion or not, we were unable to determine, but the lack of interest was painfully apparent.\n\nHoping to find more elsewhere, we swung round to Carroll's Dramatic Saloon, near the Varieties. Carroll is a sort of arbiter in the “buffing” business, and is understood to have been the go-between in the present match—or, in other words, the intermediate party through whom Allen and McCoole exchanged their preliminaries.\n\nTo our disappointment, the room was nearly empty, but we learned that there had been a distinguished company present a short time previous, and that they were expected back soon. We could not wait, however, to pay our respects to them; nor could we attend Jack Loosey's Ball, where there was a gathering of fair women and brave men, who “chased the glowing hours with flying feet,” and danced until “the wee, sma’ hours.” Here, we presume, the elite of the profession assembled, even as did the gallant English veterans on the eve of Waterloo—to march, like them, in pumps and silk stockings to the tented field.\n\nFinally, and to conclude, there did not seem to be any remarkable agitation in sporting circles last night, nor did we meet any of the bright and shining lights of the shoulder-hitting school. The event did not “draw” as it ought to have done; but we hope the fight may be no draw, and that the best man may win."

    text: "Whether St. Louis shall or shall not be the governmental centre of \"the universal Yankee nation\" remains to be decided hereafter by the force of events and the wisdom of the great American people; but she enjoys one position already, which none of her rivals dare dispute. St. Louis is the fistic centre of the Republic, beyond all question. Here are gathered the creme de la creme of pugilistic society; the pick and flower of modern gladiators; the bright, particular stars, whose orbit is in the twenty-four-foot ring; the best illustrators of \"the manly art of self-defence;\" the men who \"go in on their muscle\" as a profession, and hammer one another into bloody jelly purely as a matter of business—in short, the chiefs of the noble army of \"buffers\" are within our borders. St. Louis has an almost exclusive monopoly of these unblushing honors, and wears them as gracefully as she can under the circumstances.\n\nJohn Morrissey, once the pet and pride of the New York \"fancy,\" has fallen from his high estate, and dwindled into a mere member of Congress; Heenan, the gallant youth from Benicia, strikes no more from the shoulder, but bets judiciously, and wins frequently on trotting horses and voracious \"tigers;\" Joe Coburn has departed into unknown regions, and the rest of the illustrious ex-pounders are so entirely forgotten that we need not announce their names or whereabouts. But while the remainder of the country cannot boast of a single champion, we have no less than three of them—each ready and willing to wear the belt, or to \"belt\" one another at the slightest provocation. Allen, Gallagher, and McCoole are permanent residents and permanent attractions; they mix with ordinary mortals on terms of perfect equality, and dispense facial and liquid \"smiles\" over their respective bars at a low price for cash, or approved security.\n\nThe presence of these burning and shining lights draws a multitude of the smaller fry, who flutter around the champions like moths around a candle. And each champion has his own particular set of retainers, men who pat him on the back, shout his praises, drink his whiskey, and make themselves useful and ornamental generally.\n\nThe \"chafing\" and \"blowing\" of these fellows furnish the electric atmosphere, generating matches—for all matches are not in heaven, while those we allude to emanate from an entirely different locality.\n\nAllen's friend tells Gallagher's friend that the former can whip the latter. Gallagher hears of it, denies the soft impeachment, etc., etc., until both having screwed their courage to the fighting point, a challenge is offered and accepted, the preliminaries are arranged, the money put up, the boxers go into training, and at the appointed time the whole culminates in \"a merry mill,\" like the one expected today.\n\nWhen the fight is thoroughly cooked and ready to be served up hot, the distinguished guests from abroad begin to arrive; never standing on etiquette, or waiting for an invitation, but just stepping in \"like one of the family,\" and making themselves entirely at home. Consequently, the twelve or twenty-four hours previous to a battle is apt to be somewhat exciting and brilliant. There is a sort of freemasonry among prize-fighters, and they all seem to know each other by \"grips\" as well as passwords. No introduction is ever needed; one of these game-cocks walks into a saloon where game-cocks congregate, gives a preliminary crow, asks the crowd up to drink, and the thing is done without ceremony or cards.\n\nEvery train yesterday brought in a delegation of the P. R. fraternity. They are a curious breed, and the student of human nature who has never studied their habits has yet very much to learn if not to enjoy. What quantities of active, belligerent, original sin is wrapped up in these unregenerate bodies we do not care to inquire, but the bodies certainly are models for a sculptor. Strip yonder swaggering ruffian of his clothes, and he would show like the Apollo Belvidere. If he be in good condition, or \"in fighting trim,\" as it is called, not an ounce of superfluous flesh encumbers his bones. The massive neck sits firm and strong upon the broad shoulders; the limbs taper toward the extremities as cleanly and perfectly as those of a thorough-bred horse, and beneath the marble skin the network of muscle rises and falls like a piece of superb machinery. What splendid animals they are! But their beauty ends where their heads begin. Naturally enough they all have striking countenances, but they are not pretty, and, we presume, do not want to be considered so. There is a large preponderance of brain behind the ears, a scanty development where the organs of veneration and conscientiousness are supposed to reside; suspicious scars are scattered here and there; the nose bridges bear painful evidence of having been traveled over too often, and the ivory crop is usually short—likewise the hair. Giving the devil his due, prize fighters are seldom quarrelsome, and their behavior on the street is rather subdued than otherwise. To see them in their glory, one must go to their haunts—as we did last night. But even then he must be more fortunate than we were, else his stock of knowledge will not be materially increased.\n\nOur first call was at Tom Allen's. This establishment is on Fifth, between Biddle and O'Fallon streets, and the sign announces it as a \"Concert Saloon.\" The usual drinking paraphernalia occupy the front, and through a narrow door in a low partition the visitor passes into a narrow apartment dedicated to the worship of Bacchus and Calliope. A range of round tables and chairs are provided for the devotees of the former, and a piano perched upon a platform serves for those of the latter. Thus the twin deities of wine and music, by a convenient and satisfactory arrangement, receive their offerings at the same altar. The bar was lined by a thirsty and enthusiastic crowd, and the tables were also liberally patronized, two or three servitors being engaged in dealing out the potables, and rushing hither and thither in the most frantic manner. A young man with bright auburn hair presided at the instrument and executed a terrific accompaniment to a gentleman in his shirt sleeves who sang a terrific song in praise of lager beer. At certain intervals another gentleman rapped on the table and the whole company burst forth in a tremendous chorus which made the very rafters tremble. The audience could not be considered strictly select, in fact it was miscellaneous and variegated. Men with soft hats, men with beavers; men with good clothes on and men whose clothes were not so good; men sober as they could be, and men not so sober as they might be; but among them all there were very few of boxiana’s upper crust. The nationality of those present was English, intensely English, and the broad cockney dialect had a John Bull-ish flavor which tasted strongly of the mother country. There was not much said about the fight, but if we might judge of the popular feeling a perfect confidence was entertained in the prowess of Allen, and his friends were too sanguine to discuss the chances.\n\nSo we swung round to Charlie Gallagher’s, on Broadway. This is more spacious than its rival, but got up on the same principles and dedicated to the same purpose. A piano and a violin blended their discords for the benefit of the patrons, but no vocal harmonies disturbed the serenities of the time and place. Square, steady drinking appeared to constitute the order of exercises, but no noise or boisterous conduct was observed. Mere England was lost sight of, and we were to all intents and purposes in the heart of Ireland. Natives of \"the gem of the ocean\" circulated about promiscuously."

    text: "The approaching fight between Mike McCoole and Tom Allen, to come off within fifty miles of Cincinnati, on the 10th of next month, is already attracting the usual amount of conjectures, surmises, and attention at the hands of the devotees of the P.R. Judging from the tone of the Cincinnati press, Allen has numerous friends there, but concerning the fistic giant McCoole, little has been said. Being an advocate of fair play, we yesterday paid a visit to the chieftain at his headquarters at the Fairfield House, about four miles out on Grand Avenue, near the Fair Ground, arriving in time to find him just emerging from his customary bath after his morning's exercise. The Fairfield House, by the way, is somewhat noted as the rendezvous of professional shoulder hitters and is kept by Mr. Frank Curry. It was here McCoole trained for the Coburn \"mill,\" and its remoteness from the bustle of the city and healthy location are admirably adapted to the work of developing muscle for the contests of the ring.\n\nApproaching from Grand Avenue, we had no trouble in finding the place, for above it floated a large American flag, and across it in ample letters was painted \"McCoole's Headquarters-Training Ground.\" We walked into the bar and sitting-room and made known our business to a consumptive-looking gentleman and were informed that McCoole was just closing his morning's exercises at the bath and would soon be in. While waiting, Thomas Kelly, one of his trainers and seconds, a light-built, active, pleasant fellow by the way, came in, and we had just commenced that pumping process for which reporters are proverbial, when Mike \"put in an appearance,\" looking more like a sturdy, hearty farmer than the noted bruiser whose fame in that line is familiar in both hemispheres. Of course, we introduced ourselves, commenced business, and found him by no means backward in answering questions and giving all information possible upon the subject of training, health, etc. He is evidently used to answering questions, and the replies come out directly and to the point.\n\nMcCoole is in charge, so to speak, of James Haley, a somewhat formidable knight of the P.R. and considered one of the best trainers in the country, and Mr. Thomas Kelly, mentioned before. McCoole has now been in preparatory exercise for the \"mill\" some two months. When he commenced, his weight was 248 pounds, and, as he stands full six feet in his stockings, the reader who never saw him can form some adequate idea of his appearance. His weight now, of course, is a secret, probably known to none but himself. He admits, however, that it is very hard work to reduce himself to the requisite point for work in the ring, but he is being reduced, and yesterday he looked in admirable condition. His skin has that healthy rosiness about it which betokens excellent health and no dissipation. Indeed, he informed us that when he got ready to fight Coburn, he was in as good condition as he ever was in his life, and now he felt full as well as then. His trainers told us also that he was in splendid plight and daily improving.\n\nHe sleeps on a good mattress, with plenty of warm covering, rises promptly at five o'clock in the morning, rain or shine, and immediately proceeds to a shed room on the rear of the lot, about 10x12, where he exercises with the dumb-bells, a suspended sandbag weighing about four hundred pounds, cannonballs, and two heavy bags attached to cords running over a pulley. This exercise is continued for about a half hour and is done to develop the muscles of the arm, the flesh on which now feels like buckskin stretched over marble. After this, he wraps himself up as warm as possible and muffles up his face so as to be hardly discernible—for the purpose of producing profuse perspiration, and starts out on his four-mile walk—two in and two out. Returning, he takes a saltwater bath and undergoes a pretty severe scrubbing and rubbing process, sufficiently rough, indeed, to take the skin off almost any other man but him. After the bath, he dresses warmly again and rests a while, and then breakfasts moderately on beef or mutton, with a little trimmings—the meat, of course, always rare. His diet is substantial and varies but little from that of a laboring man, although, probably, he does not eat as much. After breakfast comes a rest of an hour or so, or until one o'clock, when he dons his walking shoes, each weighing about five pounds, and, accompanied by one or both of his trainers, and well muffled up, he starts out on a walk of from thirteen to sixteen miles—and as a walker, he is a decided success. A day or so ago, when the Natural Bridge road, and, indeed, all the roads about the suburbs of the city were in a muddy, slippery condition, he walked fourteen miles in one hour and fifty-five minutes, loaded down as he was with the heaviest of clothing, and said he felt so little fatigued that he could have repeated it in the same time. His powers of endurance are astonishing. On his return from the walk, he enjoys a short rest, then eats supper, and a short time after supper comes another walk of two or three miles. He never ventures out after the dampness of evening sets in and is in bed promptly at 8 o'clock. These are his everyday exercises, rain or shine.\n\nFor a short time after he went out to the Fairfield House, the training was pretty severe for him. It was hard to get used to the systematized work of reducing weight and at the same time develop the muscles; besides, it was a difficult matter to wean himself from the inactivity of a city life; but he soon \"came down to the work,\" so to speak, and when we saw him, he was the personification of health and strength. McCoole of the city and McCoole of the ring are two different individuals. He speaks confidently of \"getting away\" with Allen but alluded to his antagonist in complimentary terms. There is, however, in the coming mill, on the part of both these pugilists, an earnest determination to come out victorious. Pride and ambition are doing more toward making it one of the hottest contested fights ever known on the continent than the amount of money now up; and with no intervening sickness—nothing as a drawback on McCoole, he will make lively work for Allen. As we parted with the fistic giant, he was about starting on a fifteen-mile walk and kindly invited us to accompany him—we declined. Couldn't make the time in two hours as he proposed doing. Our pedal extremities were not intended for such time. We are not training for the P.R. The last we saw of McCoole, he was swinging off at a lively pace towards the Natural Bridge. He remains but about three weeks more at his present quarters, his friends are improving the time in occasional calls. Our visit was a pleasant one."

    text: "The public has learned within the last few days that the gentlemen engaged in arranging a \"diversion\" between Mike McCoole and Tom Allen have had a slight misunderstanding, leading some papers to declare that there would be no fight. The trouble was regarding the final stakeholder for the match. The stakes are $2,500 a side, and before McCoole left St. Louis to finish his training, a man named Murray was selected by his backers as stakeholder. However, Allen's backers refused to allow this honor to be conferred upon Mr. Murray. They claimed that McCoole’s friends intended to have the money in the hands of someone who would hand the stakes over to Mike if he won, and if he lost, would allow himself to be sued, thus swindling Allen out of his victory's fruits. Allen, having been twice cheated in St. Louis, was not willing for such a game to be played upon him.\n\nOn the other hand, Jack Looney, representing McCoole's backers, asserts that McCoole is neither afraid to meet Allen, nor are his backers afraid of losing their money. He claims that Allen's friends have previously sued for the recovery of their stake money after losing, and they are trying to avoid such trouble now. He insists that the stakeholder must be a responsible St. Louis party, regardless of allegiance. Carroll, representing the Allen side, has been trying to arrange matters but has been unsuccessful. Last night, Mr. Thorweger of St. Louis arrived for the same purpose. He has eleven hundred dollars interest in the stake advanced by Allen, and it is understood that if he agrees to withdraw his interest, both parties will agree upon him as stakeholder. There is every reason to believe that the complication will be satisfactorily resolved, and there will be no hindrance to the fight.\n\nEven if the stakes issue is not resolved, there is no reason why the fight should not occur. Allen says he is ready and willing to fight for the excursion money, or for nothing, to settle the question of superiority between himself and McCoole. McCoole says he will fight for one cent rather than have the match declared \"off,\" ensuring the \"sport\" will proceed.\n\nThe trouble is not with the principals but with those who have a financial interest in the affair. When there is big money at stake, interested parties naturally seek advantages. The fight was located here to guarantee fair play, but if these \"stake sharpers\" continue in this manner, it will add another weight upon the ring. Together with the disgraceful scenes of the past year, it will help in breaking up and eradicating the barbarous evil from the land."

    text: "The fancy generally had a gala day yesterday. The match made about one month since between George Seddons and John Lafferty, both having considerable notoriety in the ring, came off as advertised—the stakes being $500 a side and excursion money, at catch weights.\n\nThe morning opened like one of early spring and as early as seven o'clock the crowd commenced gathering near the foot of Morgan street, awaiting the steamer Lady Pike, which had been chartered by the friends of the parties for the occasion. About eight o'clock she came steaming up the river from the foot of Plum street, and was greeted with animation by a crowd of some fifty or more who thought the pugilists and friends were safely stored away on board.\n\nNine o’clock had been designated as the hour of starting, and the crowd gradually increased to witness the embarkation of the \"pleasure excursionists,\" so called, until as the hour arrived there was a promiscuous mass of people gathered along the levee, watching the party as they came straggling along in twos, fives and tens, ready to go down the river, up the river, anywhere to see John Lafferty \"punish\" George Seddons or vice versa. There was a vast amount of surmising and speculation in the crowd over the gangway to the steamer, carefully guarded by two persons whose duty consisted simply in taking the three dollar fee for the pleasure excursion, or its equivalent in the matter of pink colored tickets. The crowd was of all grades and nationalities gathered together in that spirit of morbid curiosity which always attaches to events of this character. From fifty to one hundred of these curiosity seekers, the number gradually swelled to about one thousand as the signal whistle and the tolling of the bell indicated the readiness of the Lady Pike to start. Down close to the water's edge gathered the crowds. In front were the advance guard of newsboys and boot blacks. Behind them there were all sorts of people, for it was an excursion of prize fighters and their friends who love such things. Many there were who went to tell those who stayed at home how the fight was conducted—how they fought, bled and fell. Of course, they did not believe in engaging in such unlawful affairs—dignity revolted at it, and besides it cost them three dollars to patronize it.\n\nWhen the bell tolled its parting there were about two hundred on board, noticeable among them were the parties in chief, Lafferty, Seddons, Carey and Gallagher. Then there was Tom Allen, Mike McCoole, Dick Roche, Billy Carroll, Frank Currie, Al Smith of Chicago, Jack Looney, Patsey Curtin, and Pat. Malloy, Tom Carey, Mike Becklin, Tom Garland, and a host of others. \"Dead beating\" was engaged in as a pleasant pastime as the boat started in the matter of a free passage. Frightful leaps were made with a resemblance of fare money in hand. A number were put ashore for want of the requisite stamps, and a guard of \"protectionists\" were formed along the larboard side to warn off, beat off and if necessity required, kick off all those whose \"inalienable rights in the pursuit of happiness\" did not extend so far as to get on board without the requisite stamps.\n\nIn one case an over-anxious protectionist drew his revolver and forced ashore some person to the party on board, indignant thus abusing one of their party, and rocks, bricks, sticks, and indeed anything available came hurling from shoreward. At first it seemed like the fire of an advance guard, and the retreat from shore as the Lady Pike swung out into the stream met with a corresponding retreat from the lower docks. As the boat swung out about half her length from the levee the hurling of rocks from shore increased, forcing all who could into the best protection available. Thick and faster they came upon the decks, at the cabin and hailing down upon the hurricane deck. Distance lends an enchantment, sometimes, to the view—so the pleasant excursionists thought in this case as they started. The boat left the \"Home Guards\" on the levee, at 10:20 A.M.\n\nThe good steamer Lady Pike is a comfortable institution; at least so it seemed to the pleasure party yesterday. Capt. C. L. Salisbury was in command, and he is entitled to the thanks of the \"pleasure party\" for kind treatment. The boat had been hired for the excursion by Roche, Mike McCoole, Lafferty and Seddons. Mike McCoole spent some time in the cabin, which, though well patronized, begot not so much mischief as many were led to suppose. In a stateroom about midships was John Lafferty, under the kind care of his trainer, Tom Kelly. He was undergoing his last preparation for the combat. It was simple—merely rubbing the hands with a preparation calculated to harden and toughen them. He appeared cheerful and confident. In the cabin were two banking institutions, one a faro bank and the other a man losing money at a game known as \"lottery,\" run by the Fakir of Ava, or at least one of them. Around these were gathered a motley crew. These, with the bar, were the only sources of interest to the \"pleasure excursionists.\" Gathered along the guards and on the bow were groups discussing the coming contest, and also the prospects of chances in the Mace-Allen fight. There was much of pugilistic history and reminiscences to be gathered among that crowd. They knew it all. Their conversation was enlightening. Down past the city the Lady Pike paddled, with her select and pleasant party. There was little betting on the trip, and there appeared to be but little money to offer in all the crowd. A watch was a curiosity; each seemed to have formed an idea that the excursionists were not all honest men, and accordingly left their valuables at home. A landing was made at Carondelet ferry landing at 10:11, and there came on board Cy Sayers with O'Keefe, of Boston, and Henry Sayers. Seddons was taken charge of by his friend Tom Allen and hurried into a comfortable berth in the rear of the boat for finishing touches.\n\nAt a quarter to 12 o'clock the party reached the head of Carroll Island about twelve miles south of this city, a spot of sand and willow growth, said to contain about three hundred and forty acres of land. It is about one mile long, and varying in width from one rod to a half a mile. This island is under the protection and laws of Illinois, and if that State is not proud of it, it is not the fault of the people. About midway on this apology for land is the remnant of a distillery where Uncle Samuel is alleged to have been defrauded out of his dues in the matter of revenue in days gone by. The Lady Pike landed near by this place. About four hundred feet back from the steep and muddy bank was a little dilapidated and doorless log cabin, and the outbuildings were in a bad state of decay. This was called the \"old distillery.\" In front of it was what might once have made some pretension to a corn-field, somewhat memorable as the spot of ground where our friend Allen was knocked out of time in a little \"mill,\" with Charley Satine last summer. Fornent the old rookery the Lady Pike landed, and an exploring party, consisting of Roche, Kelly, and a friend or so, went out to view the land, and select a site for the \"set to.\"\n\nAt 12:10 the exploring party found the only good camping place for present purposes about pistol-shot distance from the boat, upstream, on a portion of a sand-bar, and about two hundred feet back from the river, and ten feet above its level."

    text: "Tom Allen this evening will be presented with a magnificent belt by his St. Louis admirers at the Theatre Comique. Before giving a description of this really magnificent present, costing $1,000, let us say a word about the recipient. Prize fighting is a disreputable business generally, but in the western career of Tom Allen, there is something that compels a certain respect and admiration. He came here an unknown Englishman. He set up as a prize fighter and has literally fought his way to fortune and to fame. In spite of innumerable enemies and all sorts of petty persecutions, he has held his own. He is a braggart in his talk, but he is nevertheless the very incarnation of pluck.\n\nThe belt is a really splendid affair. It is thirty inches long and three and a half inches wide, formed of slightly curving plates of silver and gold joined by smooth and easy-moving hinges. In the center are five gold plates (18 carat fine); the middle one is four inches long with an elegantly chased and ornamental border. It bears the inscription \"Presented to Tom Allen by his St. Louis friends.\" A second motto, \"Audaces fortuna juvat.\" On either side were engraved representations of the American eagle and a shield, and on the corner the appropriate devices of dumbbells, Indian clubs, and boxing gloves. This center plate has on each side one gold plate of the same kind four inches long without inscriptions, however, but tastefully adorned. They are engravings of Tom Allen in the ring. In one, he is shaking hands with his opponent, and in another, he is in a fighting position. There are two other plain gold plates three inches long, and on each side, as the belt is worn around the body, will be seen three silver plates, four inches and two three inches long. There is room on the blank gold plates for Allen’s future victories to be inscribed. The whole belt is elegantly lined with leather and is altogether a beautiful piece of work. It was made under the supervision of Wm. Walsh, who superintended the belt which was presented to McCoole.\n\nTom Allen will appear in person tonight to receive this belt, and there will be doubtless an immense gathering of the fancy.\n\nThe approaching mill between Allen and Mace engages the attention of local circles, and from appearances, there will be a very large number of enthusiasts to witness the combat.\n\nBill Carroll has made arrangements with the Iron Mountain and other railroads to make their way to see the fight in New Orleans and return, for the two dollars the round trip."

About one-half the typesetting on the Paris literary papers is done by women.\n\nGeorge Sand has recently recovered from a dangerous illness. Alice Cary is so unwell that she has been compelled to give up her work on the Revolution. A Frenchman says that he thinks the great fault of American women is that they talk too loud in public. A Burlington lady has advanced so far in woman’s rights as to go to the barber's regularly to be shaved. Two young women armed with spades and hoes worked out their road tax in Beloit, Wis., the other day.\n\nMrs. Stowe is responsible for the fact that a party of Milwaukee ladies have formed a class for the study of Lord Byron's works. The viceroy of Egypt has sent an invitation to Louisa Mühlbach to spend a few months in his domains and write a book about the country. A couple of girls, aged nineteen, have purchased a farm in Warren County, Indiana. One of them attends to the house, the other manages the farm.\n\nThe young millionaire, Marquis of Bute, who was in Rome during Easter, gave Miss Edmonia Lewis an order for a copy of her famous Madonna in marble. The Empress Eugénie has appeared five times lately in the same dress. She is setting the economical fashion, which will certainly be universally followed. A York state girl of spirit couldn't stand her father’s reprimanding her, so she placed herself beyond his jurisdiction with bed-bug poison.\n\nMrs. Jennie June Croly propounded a most ominous question to her sisters: \"Let every married woman here ask herself if she meant every word of love she ever wrote to her husband.\" A vote was taken in a Vermont town on woman's suffrage. Out of eighty-two women in the district, but fourteen wanted to vote, while fifty-three declared they wouldn't vote if they could, and fifteen others did not care a button whether they voted or not.\n\nA duel was fought in St. Sebastian between the Lola Montez of Spain, the Marchioness de los R— and the Linda Vepita of Seville, a celebrity of the artistic and demi-monde world.

Wilson, wife of Senator Wilson, at Natick, Mass., on Saturday last, has been announced by telegraph. Her disease was cancer in the stomach, from which she had been a patient sufferer for many years. Her age was 43 and for 30 years she had been a member of the congregational church at Natick.\n\nA prominent woman orator says that “within these few years the voices of hundreds of women have rounded into sweetness and power, and with few exceptions, the most popular speakers of the day are women. This improvement of the voice by use, indicates a like possible improvement in thought and activity.”\n\nIn the suite of Red Cloud, the chief of the Sioux nation, who is now in Washington, are four squaws, known and designated as follows:\n\nDab-sa-no-we, alias The White Cow Rattler, wife of Swift Bear.  \nSwo-ge-nub-ha, alias Thunder Skin, wife of The One-That-Runs-Through.  \nE-dali-it-chu, alias Sans Arc Woman (the Woman Without a Bow), wife of Yellow Bear.  \nMan-ko-ha-wy-un-tab-er, alias The World Locker, wife of Black Hawk.\n\nDoctor O'Leary says that a girl can die of too much love as well as from too little. “If you ever see one of those turtle dove pairs who are always ‘my loving,’ ‘my dearing,’ ‘my ducking,’ each other,” says the doctor, “you may set it down that one or the other will die of heart disease or consumption within three months, and it is almost invariably the woman who dies. Those women,” he adds, “who always scold and speak crossly to their better-halves—they never have the consumption or die of heart disease.”\n\nThe Woman's Board of Missions met last week in Boston. Its object is to work in connection with the American Board, directing its efforts particularly to heathen women, by sending out female missionaries. It has already sent out eighteen; it employs a number of Bible readers; it has raised since the 1st of January over $10,000, and the interest it has awakened in the churches is seen in new auxiliaries being formed every week. The work is entirely their own. They manage all their own meetings, carefully excluding all of the sterner sex.\n\nMlle. Janauschek was lately interviewed at the Tuileries by the Emperor and Empress of the French. After hearing her sing, Louis Napoleon asked a young lady who accompanied her if she also possessed a special talent. She replied “No,” her only distinction consisted in being a member of Sorosis. “Sorosis,” queried the Emperor; “what is that?” “Oh,” answered the Empress, promptly, “that is something they have in America; it is a woman's club.” “Ah,” responded the Emperor, stroking his mustache, “we have nothing of that sort here.” “No,” said the Empress, “but we are going to.”\n\nThis is the remarkable story of Celestine Fejervary, a wealthy young lady of Davenport, Iowa: Recently a story was circulated affecting her chastity. She waited until some responsible person could be proved to have helped to circulate it. This proved to be no less a man than Mayor Renwick. He had thoughtlessly told the story as it came to him, and told it as deploring as if it were true. Miss Fejervary promptly sued him. She was cleared of the slander during the progress of the trial, but, because it was found that Mayor Renwick had no thought of vile intent in what he said, the verdict was in his favor. Miss F. has published a card in the Gazette, in which she says: “First of all, the failure of the jury to agree does not and cannot terminate the suit, and, should the best years of my life be spent in the endeavor, I will not rest until a verdict has been given for or against me, and, either at this court or a higher one, an example set not only to my, but all, slanderers; for, in bringing this suit, I have not been unmindful of the many innocent girls whom I have seen injured as shamefully as I have been, and much less able to defend themselves. As for the choice of this example, it fell on the first man against whom we had good proofs of his having repeated the slander in its most aggravated form (a fact which he now denies), and one who, as being an old and respected citizen, should have been the last to have given his countenance to so foul a wrong.”"

    text: "Yesterday was a day of ferment and excitement among that portion of the community designated the “fancy.” The prize fight between Allen and Gallagher had been arranged to come off between the hours of ten o'clock A. M. and two o'clock P. M., somewhere within fifty miles of St. Louis. The steamboat Belle Ida had been chartered for the occasion, and the legal difficulty relative to her departure had been smoothed away by Mr. Middleton giving bond in the sum of $1,000 to protect the other owners against possible loss or damage, so by 10 o'clock yesterday morning everything was in readiness. For a few days before the day fixed for the fight, it did not seem that the event would attract much attention. But on Monday interest in regard to the matter sprung up quite actively, and while there was but little betting, the number anxious to see the mill was quite large. It is so seldom that the police authorities of this or any other city have successfully interfered to prevent a prize-fight, that any interruption from this quarter was wholly unthought of, and there was no secrecy observed as to the time and place for the pleasure excursion to start.\n\nAt an early hour, and long before the managers of the excursion had arrived, an eager and anxious crowd had assembled on the levee at the foot of Almond street, some to take passage and some to witness the departure of the boat with its cargo of mixed human freight. At quarter before nine, the curtain \"lifted\"—Messrs. Kelly, Thurston Smith, and Aaron, stationed themselves at the gang-plank, to demand $3 from all who wished to venture on board.\n\nAs is generally the result on such occasions, the matter of guarding the gang plank was accompanied by sundry exciting skirmishes and one or more knockdowns. Several impetuous individuals, who attempted to force their way on board, were detected by the vigilance committee and forced to beat a hasty retreat and were summarily kicked off.\n\nOne fellow more bold than his predecessors jumped on board, and seemed determined to have a gratuitous passage. He was remonstrated with, coaxed, and threatened, but all to no purpose. He was finally confronted by the indomitable Tom Kelly, who picked him up as if he were a child, and consigned him to the elements of the Mississippi. A caulking flat being near at hand, the unlucky man swam to it and clambering in, succeeded in delivering himself from a watery grave.\n\nBy this time the day was passing on merrily, when the din of voices on board was drowned by a tumultuous cheer from the crowd on shore, and in a moment Tom Allen was seen marching through an admiring crowd accompanied by his trainer, Jack Maddens, toward the steamer. He was met at the gang plank by his friends and consigned to a stateroom prepared especially for his benefit. After the preliminaries had been arranged, and Tom had been directed to recline in the berth, sundry privileged parties on the boat ventured in to have a chat with him before the departure of the boat. Thomas stated that he was never better in his life, weighed 180 pounds when stripped, and was confident of success. The conversation was however, prematurely brought to a termination by Madden (Allen's trainer) rushing in and informing the party that a squad of police were on board.\n\nIn breathless silence the group in the stateroom listened for a knock at the stateroom door, speculating mentally if Tom was really about to be arrested, the day's anticipated sport prematurely terminated. The knock came and Capt. Burgess appeared at the door. But few words were exchanged. The captain after a few words of ordinary greeting said: \"The chief wants to see you, Tom, at the Central station.” Allen got up promptly and went with the officer. The crowd on the boat were evidently disgusted and vented their feelings in mutterings and curses, and only for the presence of a respectable squad of police it is quite probable a rescue of the prisoner would have been attempted. The gang plank at one time had been cast off as if to prevent the retreat of the officers of the law, but it was easily restored to its position and no other demonstration was made. Allen was taken to the Central police station and was soon within the shades of the calaboose.\n\nAfter the capture of Allen, the before happy crowd on board began to grow angry, and many an ugly oath was launched against the police and their interference. Then again the question arose, would the fight come off at all, would Allen return? and lastly but not leastly, each man suddenly became solicitous for the $3 he had paid to come on board.\n\nAt this juncture it was reported that the police were again coming to arrest all interested in the arrangements for the fight. This created a panic and a general scatteration. Barney Aaron, who acted as cashier, was seen gliding around on the outside guards of the boats, first dodging one then another, to avoid the observation of the officers. The reason was soon solved to all outsiders: Barney had the money collected for fares, and for this the police were after him. He came very near being arrested, but eluded the officer and leaped into the river. He was immediately picked up by some men in a skiff, and the last seen of Barney he was being swiftly pulled toward the Illinois shore.\n\nAfter this event the crowd gradually dispersed from the boat, and most of them congregated on Chestnut street, in the vicinity of the police office. Here the presence of so many men attracted public attention, and by 11 o'clock there was as great a crowd and as much apparent excitement, as if some great local event of importance had transpired. It is somewhat extraordinary why the announcement that \"Allen has been arrested by the police\" should have created such a stir, but not more so, perhaps, than the fact that two-thirds of the people who appeared interested in the matter manifested more sympathy with the sturdy prize fighter than the police authorities striving to prevent the prize-fight. The breaking up of the anticipated fight and the arrest of Allen, at one time yesterday formed one of the principal topics of conversation almost among all classes. The general inquiry was, \"Where is Gallagher?\" This, at first, the police did not appear to know, but having reason to believe that he was at Carondelet, Sergeant Thomas O'Neil went down there to effect his arrest.\n\nAllen was furnished with convenient quarters in the halls of the prison, where he was surrounded by half a dozen friends, to whom he talked freely, lamenting the ill-luck which deprived him of winning fresh laurels in the ring.\n\nHe appeared in excellent condition, his face and hands were bronzed like one of Whittaker's hams. His hands had rather a dirty look, but this appearance was a necessary adjunct, as they had been pickled in a decoction of vinegar and resin to harden the flesh. To the feel his skin had the hardness of iron and the flesh was as solid, as a bystander expressed it, “as old cheese.” The portion of his cheeks below the eyes were of the same character, from undergoing the same pickling process. He wore a scotch knit cap, heavy woollen coat, with a small hole torn by a nail on the right shoulder. His pants were of light cassimere, with a black stripe running down the leg."

The other conditions remain as in the articles before adopted. Gallagher, who was chafing under the disappointment of the previous day, visited Allen at his saloon on Washington Avenue, and proposed to fight him in Louisiana, Kansas, Arkansas, or Kentucky, where he supposed they would not be prevented by magisterial interference. Allen promptly said he would fight him in any of these places. They then went to a saloon on Locust Street, between Fourth and Fifth Streets, accompanied only by Madden, the trainer of Allen. Gallagher named Kansas to fight in on next Tuesday, and urged they should fight or forfeit the stakes. He said his ambition was to fight Allen, and he wanted the best man to win. Allen promptly agreed to the conditions, and he and Gallagher signed articles to that effect, nothing being altered in the previous conditions, except time and place. Gallagher said he wanted no excursion, and this was assented to by his associates. Gallagher told Allen that he was mistaken in saying that he got $16 in the Meckin fight on Carroll Island; he only got $13. They beat him, he said, out of everything.\n\nLast night another conference was held at the Broadgauge saloon. Allen, Kelly, Mike McCoole, and other members of the sporting fraternity were present. No modifications were made of the previous agreement between Gallagher and Allen, though the latter expects a different agreement will be made, as the backers of Gallagher are afraid of losing their money. Allen was very reticent. Barney Aaron returned from Illinois yesterday morning but has not yet reported in regard to receipts. He says, as an excuse to his sudden flight, that he did not know how things would turn out. He thought that he would be arrested for aiding and abetting in the fight. He knew that in the old country that the abettors were held to be worse than the principals. Mr. Madden says that he is considered to be an honest man."

    text: "Yesterday was the day when Jem Mace and Joe Coburn were to fight for £1,000 a side. It will be remembered that the fight in Canada had been interrupted by the authorities, and that Dick Hollywood had ordered the parties to fight in or near Kansas City on the 2nd day of June.\n\nOn the night of the 1st, Jem Mace, his trainer Jim Cusick, and Tom Allen of St. Louis arrived in the city and took rooms at the St. Nicholas Hotel, making that their headquarters. Mace, Cusick, and Hollywood went over to Wyandotte to be a little out of sight and retired comfortably to bed. Soon there followed them Billy Carroll, W. D. Lonergan, Thomas Allen, Charles Brownfield, and Jack Goulding. It appears that the sheriff of Wyandotte County, William Holcomb, who was in the employ of the Kansas Pacific railroad, met the party, talked with Mace and his friends, drank with them, was hail fellow well met with them, and finally attempted to capture them. They would not be taken, however, and so returned to Kansas City, where they were left unmolested and undisturbed. Kansas was up in arms. The sacred soil of this bleeding state was about to be desecrated, and one whole company of militia had been ordered out—eighty, rank and file. When Mace left, they were beginning to arrive with double-barrel shotguns and large revolvers.\n\nAbout 5 o'clock yesterday morning, Mace and his friends very quietly got into some carriages and betook themselves to a beautiful and grassy piece of ground immediately in the rear of the elegant residence of John J. Mastin. They had with them the stakes and the ropes—the same that were used in New Orleans when Tom Allen fought—and in a short time, everything was ready. Tom Allen acted as master of ceremonies. Cusick worked in a silent, effective way; Goulding was most efficient, while Brownfield, Carroll, and others looked on half lazily and half eagerly. Quite a crowd gathered, and had Coburn been present, he would have had as fair a fight as he could have desired.\n\nBut Coburn was not there, and he did not want to be there. Hollywood waited until two o'clock and called \"time!\" Mace took his position, threw his hat into the ring, leaped after it, and sat down in one corner. He waited fully twenty minutes, when Hollywood said in a loud voice:\n\n\"Joe Coburn not having made his appearance in the ring on the 2nd day of June, between the hours of 10 and 2 o'clock, I hereby declare Jem Mace the winner of the stakes, and so order that they be paid into his hands.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Mace, with a smile on his countenance; \"and I think I am entitled to them, for I have worked hard enough for them in training.\"\n\nThe £2,000 is in the hands of Harry Hill of New York, who holds it subject to the order of Dick Hollywood, the referee. Of course, Mace will now get it. Coburn was telegraphed to from Chicago and kept perfectly well advised of the movements. His failure to make his appearance is attributed to the fact that he knew full well that in Kansas City Mace would have a fair fight—this was the last thing Coburn desired. After the allotted time had expired, the ropes and stakes were taken down, and the Mace-Coburn fight, about which there has been so much talk and so much betting, was ended."

    text: "At a small town where I \"put up\" a few days ago, I witnessed an excitement wherein your correspondent unintentionally filled the role of hero in a ludicrous one-act farce. I had scarcely been in the town half an hour before I discovered an unusual excitement, and people in groups of two or three walking around the square and playing \"peeping Tom\" in every saloon and store in the place. I very naturally inquired the cause that had so suddenly broken the quiet of the little village. \"Have you not heard the news,\" said one or two. \"No,\" I replied, and inquired as to what it was. \"Tom Allen, the prize fighter, is in town, and you bet our sheriff will get him.\" It was also supposed that he was accompanied by Jem Mace, and the citizens had no idea of allowing them to remain or depart in peace.\n\nThe sheriff with two or three assistants kept on the trot around the town to hunt up the belligerents, but seemed to be meeting with poor success. I told several that I thought there must be some mistake about this, as I came in on the train, and if he had been on board I should certainly have seen him, as my repertorial duties in St. Louis had given me an acquaintance with him, but still several insisted that they had positive evidence of his being in town, for he made a call at the newspaper office and left his card with the \"devil,\" the editor being out at the time. A few of the most excited citizens went for the \"devil\" to go around and point him out should they come across him. In about fifteen minutes after, while sitting in the hotel, I heard a soft boyish voice behind me say, \"That's him,\" when immediately a gentleman touched me on the shoulder and said he would like to speak with me for a minute. I accorded him the pleasure, and stepping one side he said to me: \"Tom, you had better be getting out of here, for the sheriff and three or four of his deputies are on the hunt for you.\" I looked somewhat surprised and excited, but recovering my equilibrium I replied that I was not aware of being a fugitive from justice, that the sheriff of this or any other county should be required to be looking after me. \"Is not that your card,\" he asked? I took it in hand and found it read:\n\nTom Allen, Champion, St. Louis.\n\n\"That is not my name,\" I said; to which he informed me that he was the editor of the paper here, and that I left that card on his desk this morning, as I had been recognized by his boy as the individual.\n\nBy this time, I began to see through the ludicrous mistake which I will explain in a few words. A few days ago, while at Sedalia, I met Tom Allen, and he was very particular to hand me one of his neatly executed cards, which I dropped carelessly into my pocket. I recently had a few cards with my own name printed on them, to avoid having it so horribly butchered. They were the first I ever sported and the luck that has attended their career has brought me to the conclusion never to carry them again. The citizens accepted it largely, and the saloons took in many a coin on the strength of the excitement."

    text: "St. Louis, Sept. 23.—The prize fight between Tom Allen and Mike McCoole, which has been so long on the tapis, came off this afternoon on Chouteau Island, about 14 miles above the city. Tom Kelley and Dublin Tricks were the seconds for McCoole, and Arthur Chambers and Patsy Shepherd for Allen. The umpires were Mike Gonty for Allen and James Brounville for McCoole. Jack Looney was chosen referee.\n\nAt 12:20 o'clock McCoole entered the ring and was immediately followed by Allen. Ten minutes later the fight commenced, and was pretty much all on one side to the end.\n\nAllen forced the fighting from the start, and during seven rounds he banged McCoole until his face was cut nearly to pieces, receiving in return only two or three body blows and a slight scratch on the mouth. The following description of the 7th round will suffice to show the nature of the fight:\n\nWhen time was called, McCoole presented a terrible sight, and seemed scarcely able to hold up his head; his left eye was closed, and a terrible cut under the right eye, the right side of the upper lip almost cut off and his nose broken. Before toeing the mark Allen said: “It is a sin to bring that man up. If you don’t take him away I'll disfigure him for life; he is the gamest man I ever met.” Cries of “Take him away” were also raised by the crowd. And after some slight touches by Allen, who evidently did not desire to inflict any further punishment, and ineffectual attempts by McCoole to defend himself, Tom Kelley raised the white handkerchief in token of defeat. Allen and McCoole then shook hands in the ring, and the crowd repaired to the steamer and returned to the city. It seems to have been a square fight, and it is probable that Allen will get his money this time. About 2,000 persons witnessed the fight, among them quite a large number of well-known citizens and business men.",

    text: "Sir Thomas de Allen is out with a \"deri.\" That's what the pugilistic ink-slingers in the East call it. When a professor of the \"manly art\" offers to bet another professor a thousand dollars that he can punch his Irish snout oftener and harder than the other fellow, that's a \"deri.\" We don't cotton much to the classics on fighting subjects, but it is supposed to mean a challenge. Well, Tom Allen wants to back himself for $10,000 to fight any man in the country, which is intended particularly to include Joe Coburn of New York, and he has sent on the deri to the New York World.\n\nWe are not given much to throwing away advice, but we will this one time use for a flyer, as the Count de Looney would observe. Our advice to Tom Allen is to give up fighting, and to turn his attention to his legitimate business, which is whiskey, lager, and cigars, and the sale thereof. The ring is dead in England, and it is nearly dead here. If ever there was a remote cause for its sustainment in the sentiment and belief that it encouraged manliness, that sentiment is dead. It died in the despicable blackguardism that surrounded it. We do not intend to designate all the professors of pugilism as despicable blackguards, but a great many of them are, and the good men must suffer for the ruffianly horde that cluster round the ropes at every mill. Several of the old professors in St. Louis fully understand this, including Looney and Tom Kelly, and they clearly understand also that from this time there cannot be a fight decided on its merits except by a mere accident. Tom Allen has done enough in the fighting way, and he had better conclude to \"cut it.\" Whether he so concludes or not, he will have to do it, for a law will be passed this winter to make prize-fighting or match-making in this state an impossibility.\n\nTom has licked some very good men and some scrubs, which latter class includes McCoole and that other fraud that swindled him out of his money at Omaha. As for fighting Joe Coburn, it will come to nothing. If a match could be made—for the argument of the thing—there would be enough of the Water street crowd present to prevent anything like a fair fight. When Coburn and Mace met, didn't they stand up for an hour almost without a blow being struck? Mace didn’t want to win, even if he could have done so, and allowed Coburn’s friends to win the time money without a show of fight. Why? Because, if he had won, he wouldn't have lived a year. A year? No, not six months. The company knew this, and, having done all he could—beaten all the best men—he wanted to settle down quietly without a big feud on his hands.\n\nTom Allen, if he is wise, will give up all thoughts of fighting. This rowdyism in St. Louis born of the prize ring must be stopped. Its surroundings are brutal and disgusting, and demoralizing to our boys and young men, who are and should be superior to such vile influences and such pernicious examples. There must be an end of it, and now that another challenge is out, emanating from St. Louis, this is the time to prove that it can be stopped. Let Mr. Mudd make his bill strong and push it through on the ruse, with heavy penalties attached to its violation, and there will be an end to this disgraceful excitement about prize-fighting."

    text: "Walking along the classic banks of the tunnel on Washington Avenue yesterday, we came to the well-known hostelry of Sir Thomas de Allen, where he calls himself the champion of the twenty-four-foot-roped pugilistic ring of these United States.\n\nWe thought we would blow one of the champion’s cigars, and as we entered, the conqueror of McCoole was coming forward with a gentle smile rippling on his Spartacussian brow and informing a gentleman in a cap that if he came round there fooling, and couldn't be quiet, he'd serve him as he had McCoole, and then pitch him into the street to refresh himself.\n\n\"How are you, Tom?\"\n\n\"How are you, sir? Extraordinary what a fool a man will make of himself when he’s got it up his nose.\"\n\n\"Have a good deal of annoyance of that kind, we suppose.\"\n\n\"I should say so. Because I'm Tom Allen, any fool thinks he has the right to come in and shoot off his mouth at me.\"\n\n\"What's your opinion about the law against prize-fighting?\"\n\n\"I think it’s unnecessary and uncalled for in this state.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why? Because they never fought in the state. They always went out of the state, either into Illinois or Louisiana. I think it a mistake to put it down. It's a manly exercise and an interest to the people of the city to keep it up. Why, there's the members of the legislature that passed the bill; don’t they carry a bloody battery around with them? Isn't that worse than fighting with the fist?\"\n\nWe suggested to the champion that fighting didn’t seem to equalize matters so well as the pistol or the knife, although, of course, we didn't advocate either. Between a large man and a small man equally scienced and with equal courage, we couldn't detect the equality between them. Superior brute strength must decide in favor of the large man.\n\n\"In England,\" continued Allen, \"they don’t fight with the knife, and thousands fight with their fists every day. You don’t hear of murders there as you do here. Why? Because boys are brought up to put up their hands and defend themselves, and they don't murder one another because they quarrel.\"\n\n\"Society is differently constituted here, Tom, and men don’t end a fight with a knockdown.\"\n\n\"Yes, and look at the fellows that do draw pistols. Why, I've seen 'em turn as pale as ghosts when they do it. Do you call that pluck? Brave men don’t turn pale when they're going into a fight.\"\n\n\"Let us ask you what you think of pugilism as it exists now in this country?\"\n\n\"As it stands now, it’s quite time it was done away with. There's nothing in the manly art as it is now. No honest man has a chance; not unless he's associated with gamblers and pimps, and thieves. Then he's hunky-dory and can carry the crowd with him. The bigger the loafer, the better man he is with them.\"\n\n\"The opinion of men who are friendly to a fair fight on its merits, Allen, is that you cannot be permitted to run a fight here. The McCoole fight stands for nothing. He was a big fraud as a fighter.\"\n\n\"The man’s in trouble, I've got nothing to say against him. As to this law, can’t men fight in Canada or in York state? The law doesn’t prevent that. One law can’t make laws for another state, can they?\"\n\n\"Clearly not. But the law may read, and certainly does, that no match can be made here to fight elsewhere.\"\n\n\"What does that matter? The match can be made in Canada or New York or somewhere else in the East. In this bill, I'm made to suffer for others. Why, they put my name in it to work me, and the Times had an editorial about me that I was a refugee.\"\n\n\"What did they mean?\"\n\n\"I don’t know. I'm no refugee; I can go back whenever I want to go. I'm a prizefighter, and they can’t say any more against me than that. No man can ever say I’ve done wrong against him. I came here to live, and I'm going to stay here. When men come here from all parts to see me—some miners came here today, two hundred miles out of their way, to see the tunnel and me. One of them made a speech about me. He said he'd heard tell of Tom Allen, and he wanted to see him.\"\n\n\"Quite complimentary. And, now, don't you think you've got a better thing here, attending to your business, than wearing yourself out by training and then to get robbed out of the stakes?\"\n\n\"I side with the legislature about this bill against prize-fighting. If it’s got so that there can't be a fair fight, why, stop it. A man who wants a fair fight on its merits hasn’t got no chance. It's not the fighting men that's to blame and that break up the confidence. It's the gang that follow the ring.\"\n\n\"That I believe to be true. The fight with McCoole proved it. So long as the gentlemen were protected, and the roughs were limited to numbers, all went smooth enough.\"\n\n\"Tell me. They don’t mean to bar sparring, do they?\"\n\n\"I believe it is included in the prohibition of public exhibitions.\"\n\n\"Well, but it’s a play—the Tom and Jerry scene—and I don’t see why Deagle can’t engage two sparrers just as well as he can two trapeze men and clog and dance men.\"\n\n\"There’s some logic in that.\"\n\n\"Arthur Chambers and Billy Edwards are coming on here about the 7th of March and they want to give some exhibitions; in fact, Deagle has got them, or will have them for a week, and I don't believe Mudd’s bill can prevent it. At all events, we mean to test it.\"\n\n\"Billy Edwards has never been here?\"\n\n\"No; he's the little man that fought Sam Collyer and Barney Aaron. As for Chambers—you remember him seconding me—he's a Manchester man, and the best I ever saw of his size. He stands over 'em all!\"\n\n\"Good night, Tom, I'll call in again.\"\n\n\"Do, sir; glad to see the REPUBLICAN always. You've always been fair and honest with me, and that's all as I want from anybody.\"\n\nTom Allen looks well, but is much fatted and grosser, of course, than when in a state of preparation for his recent fights. There is also—as seen yesterday—a marked improvement in his manner. There is a larger and pleasing absence of sanguinary and profane adjectives than he was wont to interlard his very English style of conversation with a few months ago. Tom is a perfect specimen of the blunt, rough, hard-toiling, middle county Englishman, and doesn’t pick his words either for friend or foe, and would just as soon fight as eat, and a little sooner at a pinch. He reminds us strongly of one of poor Leach’s admirable Punch sketches of life in the black country (coal counties) of England. A rough \"navvy\" is leaning against a post, and a girl—his wife—has just come up. It is three o'clock in the afternoon, and he wants to be ganging homewards. She says:\n\n\"Bill, hast thee had thee fight, lad? If thee hasn't, thee'd better get thee fight over, and let us get along home.\"\n\nIt being impossible to come to town without having a fight."

    text: "Sporting men in this city and St. Louis are in high glee over the prospects of another prize-fight being arranged between Jem Mace, now in London, and Tom Allen of St. Louis. A few weeks since, the latter issued a challenge, offering to fight Jim Mace, Joe Coburn, or any man in the world, for $1,000 to $3,000. A prominent sporting man in this city at once informed Mace of Allen's intention. Mace sent word back that if Allen would fight, he would return to America and fight Allen according to the latter's terms. Allen was informed of the fact, and in reply says: \"I am surprised that Jem Mace thinks I do not mean business. He knows that I never backed out. I now desire to inform Mace that I am ready to make a match to fight him a stand-up fight, according to the new rules of the London prize ring, two, three, or four months from the signing of the articles, for from £1,000 to £5,000 a side, the fight to take place in Kansas, New Orleans, or Canada. I will be ready to meet Mace or his backers from New York, at Pittsburgh or Cincinnati, on any day he may name, to sign articles and post a deposit of $500. If these terms do not suit Mace, I am prepared to fight Joe Coburn at either of the above places, and will wager $2,500 to Coburn’s $1,500; or I will fight Ben Hogan for from $1,000 to £5,000, and give him any length of time he wants to train. I mean business, and hope Mace, Coburn, and Hogan will not refuse to meet me.\"\n\nQuite a number of sporting men have been under the impression that Allen did not care about meeting Mace, and it was generally supposed that he preferred avoiding him. The readers of the Times will remember that Mace and Allen fought a brutal contest in New Orleans, in May, 1870. In that contest, Allen was defeated. Since then, Allen has improved, as his last contest, on Chouteau Island, Ills., last fall, showed. It was at this contest that Allen begged McCoole's seconds not to let him come up again, and a number of the more tender-hearted roughs, who surrounded the ring, shouted to McCoole’s friends: \"Take him away.\" The sporting men of this city think Allen is no match for Mace. The latter will be backed from this city, while Allen will be backed from St. Louis. All that remains to complete the preliminaries for another brutal exhibition between these noted pugilists is for Mace’s backer to name the time and place of meeting to sign articles."

    text: "So many rumors are afloat regarding the prospects of a fight between Tom Allen and Jem Mace, that a correct statement or history of the affair at this time may not prove uninteresting. Before doing so, however, it may be in order to say a word or two regarding the New York Clipper, a sporting paper devoted ardently and exclusively to the interests of the Eastern fancy. No Western man ever had a fair field, and no favor in its columns, and Allen hits the sheet some pretty hard raps, as will be seen by a perusal of the appended documents.\n\nIt is a well-known fact that the greater part of Joe Coburn’s reputation was made by this paper, and very little of it inside the ropes. For almost four hours he and Mace faced each other without either receiving a scratch, for which performance, Coburn was lauded to the skies. This very fact went to prove that Joe could not be whipped by anyone desiring to take up a permanent residence in New York, as the idea of the scientific Gypsy being unable to mark him is preposterous.\n\nMace is a towering genius inside the ropes, with more schools of fighting in his head than all the fighters in this country combined have ever dreamed of. A man whose face cannot be touched, and whose hand and forearms are always ready to anticipate almost any character of blow; a wrestler who can fall when it is necessary, and yet bring down his man to his own advantage.\n\nTo return to Allen. Shortly after being robbed of his fight with Ben Hogan, the Pittsburgh fraud, Tom forwarded the following letter to Billy Harding of the New York News and when published it created quite a stir:\n\nTo the Sporting Editor of the News—Sir: Not being able to receive fair play through the New York sporting press, I solicit space in the sporting column of your valuable paper to present this card to the public. The last issue of the Clipper states that Mr. Joe Coburn is to appear in sparring exhibitions, and styles himself \"Champion of America.\" I wish to inform Mr. Joe Coburn that I will fight him for $2,500 a side, or as much more as he can raise, the fight to take place in Canada, within fifty miles of Detroit, Michigan; to have no excursion but to fight for the money up, the number of men to accompany each party to be limited to twenty. This will prevent all interference, and we will fight three months from signing articles. I will meet him or any of his friends halfway between here and New York, say Pittsburgh, to make arrangements, but I will take no notice of any challenge issued through the columns of the Clipper by Coburn or anyone else. I claim to be champion of America, and I am ready to back it up. To show the prejudice the Clipper has against me, I will here state that in my fight with McCoole in 1869, the Clipper recognized me as champion of America. They knew what my name was then. They called me Tom Allen, but in my late fights they have tried to cast a slur on me by calling me \"The Englishman.\" The Clipper is supposed to be the sporting paper of America, and the paper which sporting men refer to for a just and honest decision. In my last fight with Ben Hogan they claimed that I struck Hogan below the belt. If hitting a man in the pit of the stomach is \"below the belt,\" why then they go against all rules of Fistiana. The Clipper must know that if a \"foul\" was committed in the second round it could not be claimed in the third round.\n\nA murderous gang of cut-throats from Council Bluffs and Cheyenne tried to force me to lose the fight at Omaha with revolvers and bowie knives at my head. The Clipper upheld, instead of exposing them, as it should have done.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say, if Joe Coburn does not accept my challenge, I will fight Jem Mace, or any man in the world, for from $1,000 to $5,000 a side.\n\nRespectfully,  \nTom Allen,  \nChampion of America, 417 Washington Avenue, St. Louis.\n\nJoe Coburn was quite ill when the above manifesto appeared and did not reply to it. It was also stated at the time that Joe had promised his wife that he would not participate as a principal in the squared circle again and all likelihood of a fight between him and the champion was abandoned.\n\nA prominent sporting man of New York, however, at once informed Mace, who was in London, of Allen's intentions. Mace immediately replied that if Allen meant business he would return to America and make the match. Tom was informed of this fact and at once wrote to a friend in Gotham as follows:\n\n\"I am surprised that Jem Mace thinks I do not mean business. He knows that I never backed out of fighting men. Now I desire to inform Mace that I am ready to make a match to fight him a fair stand-up fight, according to the new rules of the London prize ring, two, three, or four months from signing articles, for from $2,000 to $5,000 a side, the fight to take place in Kansas, New Orleans or Canada. I will be ready to meet Mace or his backers from New York at Pittsburgh or Cincinnati, on any day he may name to sign articles and post a deposit of $500. If these terms do not suit Mace, I am prepared to fight Joe Coburn at either of the above places, and will wager $2,500 to Coburn's $1,500, or I will fight Ben Hogan for from $1,000 to $5,000, and give him any length of time he wants to train. I mean business, and hope Mace, Coburn, and Hogan will not refuse to meet me.\"\n\nAbout a week ago a private letter was received from Mace stating that if Tom Allen wants to back up the challenge he recently issued, wherein he offers to fight any man in the world for from $1,000 to $5,000 he will accept and fight Allen, if the latter will post a deposit in the Clipper office or Wilkes' Spirit to show that he means business. Mace has lost heavily in book-making in England, and intends to arrive at an early day in New York.\n\nThe New York News, in a recent issue, contains the following regarding the match: The fight between these men near New Orleans showed Mace a general who could stand his opponent off all the time, lead at pleasure, provoke a counter, and yet keep his right always in reserve. He whipped Allen easily in ten rounds, and never received a black eye. Since then Allen has improved, as the last contest on Chouteau Island, Illinois, last fall, proved. It was at this contest that Allen begged of McCoole's seconds not to let him come up again, and a number of the more tender-hearted who surrounded the ring shouted to McCoole's friends to take him away. Sporting men of this city think Allen is no match for Mace. The latter will be backed from this city, while Allen will be backed from St. Louis. All that remains to complete the preliminaries for another brutal exhibition between these noted pugilists is for Mace's backer to name the time and place of meeting to sign articles. The sporting men of St. Louis are of opinion that the New Orleans fight was a gift to Mace."

The bill was a most attractive one, and had it been carried out as advertised, no one would have been able to complain. It appeared, however, that in advertising a \"sparring exhibition\" between the champion, Tom Allen, and Jimmy Walsh of London, the management had unwittingly proposed to violate a statute of the last Legislature prohibiting such exhibitions in public, and the authorities notified Mr. Mitchell that he could not be allowed to carry out his programme. Tom Allen appeared on the stage, though, wearing his champion’s belt, and was greeted with most vociferous applause. The interference of the authorities with this portion of the programme having been explained, Allen was about to retire, when the audience demanded a song. Though not down in the bills as a vocalist, Allen complied with the request at once and sung three or four songs, to the great gratification of his friends and admirers. Upon the appearance of Miss Nully Pieris, some evil-disposed persons in the crowd raised a hiss and she indignantly left the stage. The more reputable portion of the audience refused their sanction to such an outrage, and applauded enthusiastically and energetically until she returned and concluded her song. The other portions of the performance passed off smoothly and most satisfactorily. The Rickards, Manning's Female Minstrels, Miss Nully Pieris, and the entire variety combination tonight in a most attractive programme.",

    text: "Tom Allen is matched to fight George Rooke of New York, for $2,500 a side and the championship, early in the spring. On last Sunday week, Arthur Chambers, champion of the lightweights, put up $250 for a binder for Allen in the hands of Harry Mill, and the backers of each were to meet last night to sign articles of agreement to fight within five hundred miles of New York, at catch weights, and according to the rules of the London prize ring.\n\nWe thought that Allen had wisely decided to give up slogging for a profession and attend to his business as a saloon keeper, as an infinitely more respectable way of gaining a living, but the old desire to appear once more within the twenty-four foot roped ring has come over him, and in he goes with one of the greatest gluttons as a pugilist that is to be found perhaps in all the world. We cannot recall the men with whom Rooke has fought, but enough is known of him to say that he is a thoroughly game man, a hard hitter, a good wrestler, and if he does not possess as much science as Allen, he has a physical system that can receive as much, and perhaps more punishment than his prospective adversary. He is a Bowery and Houston rough of the roughest kind, and either belongs to Joe Coburn’s crowd or the crowd that is against Joe, and those two crowds comprise all there is of New York roughery. He has fought several times with the best second-class men and nearly always came off A1; the last fight in which he was matched, having been scratched by reason of a bar-room fight, in which somebody was nearly or quite killed, we forget which. Under any circumstances, Rooke is no gift to Allen or any other man now in the ring, and if it ever comes to a mill, which we doubt, Allen, even if he should win, will not be sorry when Barney Aaron throws up the sponge for his pal.\n\nThe fact of all this is—assuming that a fight is meant on both sides—that there is a determination among the New Yorkers to lick Tom Allen if they can. A quiet feud has existed for some time between Joe Coburn and Allen, and the latter would sooner fight Coburn than any man living, bar none. Coburn has got all the will to respond, but there's nothing left of him inside, and he and all the New York sporting men know it. If Joe were as good as when he crossed the Atlantic to fight Jem Mace, he could meet Allen and there wouldn't be a cent’s choice between them. But Coburn isn’t that kind of a man now, and feeling irritated at the constant challenges—officially and otherwise—slung from West to East at him, he and his crowd have put up Rooke against Allen, knowing that Rooke can stand long enough against the Western man to win bets on time and, perhaps, have a chance of bringing off the stamps.\n\nLet us look at Allen. He has done nothing in this country but beat a lot of good novices like the Gallaghers, and that slouchiest of all chopping blocks, Mike McCoole. Jem Mace handled him with ease in New Orleans, although he did tell Arthur Chambers that he gave Mace his head because he found the old man was getting slow. But Mace is an exceptional man, and fighting on the dead square to win. No man in the world in his day had a chance with him barring accidents, such, for instance, as befell Allen in that knockdown under the jugular with Gallagher; Allen has always been a good man. His fights with Joe Goss, the best of the second-class men in England, were rough affairs, and Rooke comes nearer to Goss than any man we can think of. Rooke has got more rough dash than old Joe had, but they are of the same stamp. Since Allen fought Goss, some years have passed, and Allen is older; still, on that score, perhaps, with the exception of wrestling skill, the advantage in physique is in favor of Allen, who has taken his wince out of a fast life a little more serenely. As for the mill, if the men ever do meet in the ring, the chances are that it will never be fought out to a satisfactory result. Five hundred miles from New York means in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, and what with the Houston street crowd and the Hogan crowd who have no love for Allen, there will be some lovely work before Barney Aaron and Joe Coburn suffer the sponge to be thrown up to scoop down their ducats."

    text: "A night or two since, the sporting reporter of the Globe and a gentleman having the appearance of a bank president were seated together at a table in a rear room of \"The Champion's Rest.\" From the surroundings, it was evidently the home of a pugilist. A steel engraving of Joe Goss, in ring costume and fighting attitude, was hanging from a peg, flanked on one side by the All England Eleven at the Oval, and on the other by an excellent portrait of the proprietor himself. Behind the bar were several gold-headed canes, a massive silver goblet, and a mammoth gold belt, proclaiming for itself that the owner was Champion of America.\n\nHe it was who conversed with the reporter. Few would suspect that the personage attired in a perfectly fitting black coat and vest, lavender pantaloons and silk hat, neat necktie and immaculate linen, was none other than Tom Allen, the famous knight of the fives. On the little finger of his left \"duke,\" sparkled a valuable diamond. The broken nose and scarred features always coupled with a pugilist’s appearance were missing, thus denoting that science had kept the face well protected in his numerous battles. Tom is not only a magnificent specimen of physical manhood, but is handsome, likewise.\n\nThe reporter had called to interview him in regard to the approaching \"mill\" with Rooke, and have a chat on ring matters generally. Did he object?\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\nThe reply being courteous, the conditions of the battle were first discussed, and it was ascertained that the fight comes off on the 17th of June, within fifty miles of Pittsburgh, and is for $1,500 a side.\n\n\"What gave rise to the match?\"\n\n\"You see,\" said the champion, \"Rooke challenged me in the New York papers, and then went around giving exhibitions and announcing on his bills that he would fight Tom Allen. He also stated that I challenged Joe Coburn because I knew he would not fight me. His original challenge was for $2,500 a side, and I got to hear of it through Arthur Chambers. Although I had determined to quit the ring, this bluster annoyed me, and I authorized Arthur to cover the deposit. They met at Harry Hill's, in New York, on the 16th of February, when Rooke wanted to reduce the stakes to $1,000 a side. We wouldn’t accommodate him at this, but finally compromised on $1,500. I blamed Chambers for giving Rooke his own way in everything else, but Arthur said not to let the bloke out of it.\n\n\"Will there be any excursion?\"\n\n\"No, Rooke wanted one, but I wouldn't have it unless all the money went to the winner.\"\n\n\"Who is this Rooke, anyhow?\"\n\n\"He is of Irish descent, and, like myself, was born in Birmingham. We were boys together. He is about thirty-four years of age, one year older than myself. He is pretty clever with the gloves, but bless your soul, gloves is nothing to go by. He can’t fight above one hundred and forty, let them fatten him as they please. He has never licked any first-class man. Why, Collins, the Cast Iron Man, and Rocky Moore, both novices, beat him. Jack Madden whipped Collins in ten minutes over the river.\"\n\n\"How long will it take you to use him up?\"\n\n\"I shall lick him in ten or fifteen minutes. I'm as clever as he is, and it stands to reason that a man forty pounds lighter than me, with less science, must cry enough. I shall go at him like a bloody Turk and fight him in the middle of the ring. Bet you a bottle of wine he won’t have his hands up two seconds till I'm at him. He's so narrow, you see, that a thump in the ribs will make him sick. I'll hit him where I hit Hogan. It makes them tremble all over. If you hit a man below the belt it don't hurt him at all, but just above, it is the pot, especially for a narrow man. I'm so thick here and I know his every move. It takes a very well, even if he don't.\"\n\n\"What do you suppose induced the match?\"\n\n\"They had it in New York.\"\n\n\"How do you feel?\"\n\n\"Never was better in my life. I'm as hard as door-nails. Have reduced myself by preliminary exercise from 225 to 200 pounds already, and will fight at about 170 pounds. I haven’t had a sick day since I came to St. Louis, eight years ago, and could lick a whole street full of such men now, as I could then. I consider myself younger today than I was then. You see I was a wild young fellow in those days, but have been very steady since my marriage. Keep good hours, and naturally am in splendid condition. Feel them muscles,\" said Allen, straightening out his leg.\n\nThe thigh and calf were assuredly as hard as metal, causing the newspaper man to wonder where the other twenty pounds of superfluous flesh were to come from.\n\n\"When do you leave for Pittsburgh?\" continued the reporter.\n\n\"On Sunday night, and I go into training at McKee's Rocks, six miles below there, at once. That's my old training grounds. Johnny Newell, of Pittsburgh, and Young Donnelly will look after me. Sam French's, 5 Tenth Street, will be my headquarters in Pittsburgh.\"\n\n\"Who will second you?\"\n\n\"Barney Aaron and Owney Gagin. I understand Joe Coburn and Butt Riley are to esquire Rooke.\"\n\n\"Is all the money up, and who is final stakeholder?\"\n\n\"No; only $1,000 a side has yet been posted. The other $1,000 is to be put up at Harry Hill's on the 1st of June, when the choice for place of fighting will be tossed for. Hill is the stakeholder.\"\n\n\"Do you anticipate foul play?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I have lots of friends in Pittsburgh who will see that I get a fair show. A number of my St. Louis friends are also going to the fight. Looney and others will be on hand. Arthur Chambers, Patsy Shepherd and a big delegation from New York and other Eastern cities are going. The mill will take place to a certainty.\"\n\n\"Will the authorities interfere, think you?\"\n\n\"I think not. From the articles, we can fight either in Pennsylvania, Ohio or West Virginia, each State being within fifty miles of Pittsburgh. After this battle, I will under no circumstances whatever again enter the ring. I had abandoned it for good, but was abused so by Rooke through the press, that I could not resist the temptation to punish the braggart. I am comfortably situated, and want to quit the business. No challenges whatever will be noticed by me in future, and no inducements will be strong enough to get me in the ring again.\"\n\n\"A pugilist must have queer feelings when time is called?\"\n\n\"I'm very peculiar that way, and don't want to be bothered by anyone. I have certain resolutions made up in my own mind, and while watching my opponent, am figuring how to carry them out.\"\n\n\"The public would like to hear something regarding your career as a pugilist from yourself.\"\n\n\"There ain't much to tell. I've fought (pronounced 'phote' by all prize-fighters) twenty-one times, and won eighteen battles. I was brought up in Birmingham, the Iron City that has turned out more first-class men than all the rest of England. When only seventeen years old I ran away from home and enlisted in the 8th Hussars, and was all through the Indian mutiny, under General Havelock. My first ideas of the manly art were learned in the army. My maiden effort in the ring was with one of the 13th Infantry at the Punjab Forts in India for ten shillings, or two dollars. I never knew I could fight till then. On returning to England I became prominent as a pugilist. I was whipped twice there, but both were off-hand matches. Never was beaten in England in a match for which I trained. When twenty-two years old and weighing only 134 pounds, one Saturday night, I was matched to fight Posh Price on Monday morning. He was twenty-eight years old, and sixteen pounds heavier. He licked me in two hours and four minutes. My longest battle, which lasted two hours and forty-seven minutes, was with..."

    text: "For the past two weeks, sporting men have been eagerly looking forward to the fight between Tom Allen and George Rooke of New York for the honor of the title champion of America and $3,000. Preliminaries for this contest were arranged in such a business-like manner that those who had looked upon the match with suspicion and distrust changed their minds and believed the pugilists would fight. On June 1, the final stakeholder was selected, Mr. Jno. Chamberlain. He accepted. A few days later, he was informed that Joe Coburn had organized a gang of ruffians to go on to Pittsburgh and win the fight for Rooke if he was not able to do so himself. This plan was to be carried out strictly to the letter, as follows: If the Rooke party could not secure a referee in their favor, they determined to win the fight on an alleged foul. If they were balked in the referee business, the gang from New York were to crowd in Allen’s corner, and when Rooke forced the fighting, a cry of foul was to be raised in Allen’s corner by Rooke’s friends. Then the latter were to break down the ropes in Allen’s corner, and Rooke’s seconds were to claim the fight on the ground that Allen’s friends broke into the ring. The referee would then be obliged to give his decision in favor of Rooke, according to the rules. Backers of Rooke would then receive the stakes, and if Allen sued, he could not recover. Chamberlain, however, at the eleventh hour, declined having anything to do with the affair because two of his friends had money in Rooke’s $1,500, and they, understanding they were to be cheated out of it, claimed the money they had put in the stakes, and he refused to have anything to do with the affair. No blame can be attached to Allen. He thought he had only to fight and win. Rooke was also anxious to fight, knowing that if he could not win, the Coburn gang would win for him.\n\nPrize-fighting has fallen into decay, not only among the once reputable sporting men but among the rougher element who have patronized pugilists. The wretched bruisers who have formed the central figures of the brutal gatherings found that getting a shocking drubbing with the usual mutilations put money only into the purses of their backers. A prize fight for $3,000 meant that certain well-to-do brutes stood a chance of winning as much more as they could extra from the savage curiosity of the motley crowd by excursion money. Because there was no possibility of an excursion from Pittsburgh is one of the principal reasons why Rooke’s backers would not agree to Harry Hill of New York for stakeholder. The victor in one of the latter-day fights found himself a beggar around the fishy haunts of his patrons, while the vanquished, with a face like a piece of claret jelly, thrown against the wall, was despised and left helpless on the scene of the contest. So the pugilists wisely deserted what was miscalled ‘the manly art,’ to the swindling tactics of their backers. Fights were arranged, excursions got up at five dollars each; no fights took place, except occasional “scrimmages” during the trip when some citizen objected to being robbed by gamblers and thieves, who were passed on board free in order that they might break up the fight if wanted. The principals in the meantime are purposely arrested or take the wrong train, or if they do get into the ring, they fail to agree upon a referee.\n\nTo-day the backers of the men met to decide upon a final stakeholder, when it was discovered that Shaughnessy, one of Rooke’s backers, had put an attachment on the stakes now held by Harry Hill. Mr. Muldoon, another of Rooke’s backers, authorized Billy Edwards, Allen’s representative, to notify Allen that when Shaughnessy withdrew his share of the money, he would make up the deficit to one thousand, and if Allen would agree to fight Rooke for that amount, within ten days, 50 miles from Pittsburgh, he would post that amount with Harry Hill. Rooke is here waiting for Allen’s reply. He would have left for Pittsburgh, but his backers would not give him money to go.",
    summary: "Tom Allen and George Rooke's anticipated prize-fight was undermined by Rooke's camp's alleged foul play, highlighting the declining integrity and corruption in 19th-century pugilism."

    text: "In reply to a card of Tom Allen's, in which he states that he retires from the ring, Rooke, who wants to fight, says: \"Allen, in announcing his retirement from the ring, has seen fit to make an unjustifiable assault upon Ben Hogan and myself. My match with Allen was for 1,500 a side, to be fought June 17. Harry Hill was temporary stakeholder, and the final stakeholder was to be agreed on. Mr. John Chamberlain was selected. Through a misunderstanding between Allen and Harry Hill, in regard to the money alleged to be due to the latter, a delay took place in the transfer of the stakes to Mr. Chamberlain and he refused to act.\n\nJames Collier was mutually agreed upon, but declined, and after ineffectual attempts to agree, the friends of Allen and my representatives declared the match off. I telegraphed that the match was off, in conformity with the articles of agreement, through the failure to agree on a stakeholder. I was prepared to renew any amount, or to fight him for the championship without a dollar. After these notices and with the knowledge that he would be alone in the ring, Allen went to the ground, stepped into the ring and claimed the stakes. We could not meet on the seventeenth under our old articles of agreement, and he knew I wanted a new match. He knew I would not be in the ring.\n\nKnowing all this he threw in his cap, showed his own bravery, accused me of cowardice and ran away. I now ask Mr. Tom Allen to test his own and my courage by fighting me without stakes. If he accepts I will bet him one thousand dollars that I whip him, which will pay his expenses, should he be victorious.\"\n\nHarry Hill says: \"The late failure to decide the issue of Allen vs. Rooke in the roped arena, makes it my duty, being the temporary stakeholder of 3,000, made dependent thereon, to notify publicly all parties having a money interest thereon, to present their claims, either in person or by proxy for prompt adjudication and settlement, on or after Monday, June the 25th instant.\"\n\nHe believes that both men made the match in good faith, that both were anxious to fight, and but for the untimely interference of parties interested in the monetary issue would unquestionably have fought out the issue to the bitter end, both being courageous and skillful men. He says Rooke is anxious to fight Allen, and so are Coburn and Hogan, and that Allen ought to fight to decide the question and then retire.",
    summary: "Tom Allen's retirement sparked controversy with Rooke, who challenged him to an unstaked fight amidst a 19th-century boxing dispute involving stakeholders like Harry Hill."

    text: "The following special telegram to the Republican was received last night:\n\n\"NEW YORK, June 28. — Sporting men here are again rejoicing over a fresh match being arranged between Allen of St. Louis and Rooke of this city. The latter, with Billy Borst, M. Shaughennessy, and many sporting men were at Harry Hill's this afternoon when arrangements were made by them to fight within fifty miles of Detroit, on the 15th of July. The men are to fight for fun and the championship of America, and on them backers are to wager $1,000 aside, or more at the ring, which Harry Hill is to hold and give to the winner. Rooke is allowed to select the battleground and will have to notify Allen five days before the day elected for the battle. Rooke has continued training since the fizzle. Upon the above terms, there is every prospect of a fight. Harry Hill represented Allen, but Rooke transacted his own business. The $3,000 stakes at the first match between Allen and Rooke were returned to the parties who posted them today. Harry Hill retains $1,000 of Allen’s money to post on the coming contest.\"\n\nOn receipt of the above intelligence, one of the intellectual emissaries attached to the local department of the Republican was dispatched to seek an interview with the muscular celebrity whose residence among us has made our city the headquarters of one of the cherished institutions of the country. Deep within the classic shades of \"Tom Allen's Free and Easy,\" the champion himself was found, in the center of a collection of choice spirits. The reporter announced to him the intelligence received from New York concerning the new arrangements for a fight between himself and George Rooke, and asked if this were thus. Allen replied that the information was new to him; that Harry Hill was duly authorized to act for him, but had not as yet sent him word of the consummation of the new arrangements. The Republican could ascertain definitely by telegraphing to Harry. Having ample confidence in its New York correspondent, Mr. Hill was not consulted by the Republican for confirmation or denial of his statement; and it may be expected that unless some contingency at present unforeseen should arise, Allen and Rooke will meet and punch one another’s heads at the time and place hereinbefore stated.",

    text: "A special dispatch received in this city from New York has created considerable buzz in sporting circles. In substance, it is a challenge from the renowned English champion and claimed champion of the world, Jem Mace. A short time after George Rook of New York failed to meet Allen in the \"squared circle,\" Tom, not wishing to settle down to the quiet humdrum of life on Washington Avenue, issued a challenge to fight any man in this country or out of it, for a purse of from $2,500 to $5,000 a side, and the championship of the world, the fight to be \"catch-weights,\" according to the rules of the London ring. After a long time, Jem Mace has seen fit to accept the challenge and has forwarded the following note:\n\nYORK HOTEL, WATERLOO ROAD, LONDON, Oct. 27. —In reply to the challenge of the would-be champion of the world, Tom Allen of St. Louis, whom I beat at Neenerville, Louisiana, in May 1870, in ten rounds, forty-four minutes, allow me to state that if Mr. Allen is sincere and claims to be the champion of America and desires to make a match, please inform him that I will fight him a fair stand-up fight, according to the new rules of the London Prize Ring, within fifty miles of Detroit, Mich., or within fifty miles of Pittsburgh, in three months from signing articles, for £200 or £1,000 a side. Allen has no claim to the championship of America, let alone the world, as I beat him for £2,500 a side and the title, which he cannot deny. I sail from London on Dec. 5. If Allen is not a boaster but will back up his challenge, let him send a deposit of $250 to Frank Queen. I will telegraph the same amount by cable and sign articles on my arrival in New York. Before I left America, Allen was afraid to fight. If he refuses now, after all his boasting, the public will know what to think. JEM MACE, Champion of the World.\n\nAllen was notified by telegraph and promptly replied that he was ready for Mace on his terms, £5,000 a side, and expressed a willingness to cover any amount Mace may put up. Sporting men here say Allen is a much better man now than when he fought and was defeated by Mace in 1870, and they are willing to back up their big money. Mace's English friends are giving him a grand benefit before he leaves for America. Should the proposed \"mill\" not prove a \"fizzle,\" it will be a hard one, as both men are the cream of heavyweights. Allen has never been known to \"weaken,\" and if Mace means business, he will have his hands full when he puts his \"dukes\" in position before big Tom.\n\nAllen went to Chicago on Thursday and met Harry Hill of New York and Barney Aaron. Hill represented Mace. Tom put up $250, covering Mace's money for a £5,000 a side fight. The articles of agreement were drawn up, signed, and placed in Mike McDonald's hands. As before stated, Allen is not the least loth to meet the gypsy and give him a sound thumping.\n\nTom Allen returned from Chicago this morning. There is, as he says, no truth in the report that he put up any forfeit for a fight with Jem Mace, who is in Leeds, England, engaged in the poultry business. Should he return here and make such a challenge, it may be realized, but as matters now stand, the whole thing is a fraud.",

    text: "Cullen occasionally rises to very plain, practical, and common sense remarks about the police and the detective force in general, for the course pursued by them in arresting and punishing criminals. The DISPATCH of last Wednesday anticipated the words by giving abstracts in connection with the arrests of two hotel boys and a peddler. These cases were called in court and prosecuted by special officer Maloney. Those men were arrested several days ago without any cause and detained ever since, notwithstanding the fact that their friends were able and willing to give bail.\n\nWilliams was brought in Tuesday by Officer Nena, who is also a special and partner of Maloney, and locked up at the Chestnut Street Station. When Mr. Nan entered the Station, he marched up to the counter, and in answer to the question of Sergeant Rilliet, \"What's the charge?\" simply said, \"Put him on the hold overs.\" The usage of the department made this sufficient for the sergeant, and without further ceremony, Williams was searched and locked up. A friend of his came in a few minutes afterwards, and in the presence of a DISPATCH representative told Sergeant Rilliet that Williams was an honest man, a puddler by trade, and that both had come down from the rolling mill. Said he: \"If there's any charge against him I will go and tell his uncle and he will give the necessary bond.\" The Sergeant gave him to understand that he was not his prisoner. He was brought there by one of the chief's staff, and it was his duty to hold him.\n\nWilliams’ occupation was so plainly indicated by his general appearance that no one, pretending to have any knowledge of detective work, could take him for a thief. His hands and fingers were all blistered, no doubt from the sparks of the hot iron, and his clothes and face smutty with the smoke and dirt. The facts of the matter may be put into one sentence. Messrs. Nan and Maloney have been assigned to special duty by the vice-president of the Board, and they want to make a record. That’s all.\n\nMcNeiss, to whom reference was made in the DISPATCH of Wednesday, swore out a warrant against Maloney this morning. He was arrested by him and thrown into calaboose without any cause whatever. Such proceedings would not be tolerated in a semi-civilized community, much less here where we have an exalted civilization and a habeas corpus act.\n\nA few evenings ago, officers went into Tom Allen's saloon and created a commotion there by their extraordinary conduct. Maloney walked up to a young man who was sitting in the chair, and, as one of the bystanders remarked, \"snatched him bald-headed.\" The young man protested, and not knowing who his assailant was, prepared to defend himself. Tom Allen, seeing the disturbance, told Maloney to show his authority, and the party would go with him. The officer immediately jerked out a revolver and said, \"there it is!\" This is certainly high-handed justice.",

It is said to be an American drama, and Tom Allen is to play the hero in it. We have never yet seen a true American hero on the stage. The field is open, and the honor of presenting the American type of man may be reserved for Tom Allen for aught we know or can guess. Notable debuts have of late been made by ambitious aspirants of the female sex—male candidates for full-grown histrionic honors being almost unknown. If Allen ventures he will be a novelty on this account. What his play and character are like we have no idea. We believe Allen’s old antagonist in the 24-foot ring, and histrionic precursor, Jem Mace, appeared on Niblo’s stage, New York, as Charles, the wrestler, in \"As You Like It,\" a Shakespearian role. If Shakespeare could make a part for a wrestler, there is no reason why a modern playwright should not write a play for a boxer.\n\nWe presume that Allen's venture, if he makes it, will be one of muscle rather than brains, and there is no reason why he shouldn’t win. When we hear more about it, we'll tell more, and shall await with anxiety the advent of the American hero on the dramatic boards."

    text: "The prizefight between Johnny Dwyer and Steve Taylor, of Jersey City, for $500 and the championship of the heavyweights, is still the subject of discussion among the sporting circles of Brooklyn and this city. It is certain that Taylor, on last Monday, was no match for Dwyer, and the latter's chances of winning were never in doubt after the second round. It has often been proved, and is beyond doubt, that a man must be well trained and in condition to successfully participate in any competition, especially a contest like that on Monday. It was the same as a prizefight, except that the principals had gloves on.\n\nBoth men knew they had to win by hard blows and endurance. Taylor was not in condition, and he wore shoes without spikes and was unable to keep his feet. Taylor, in a recent contest with Prof. Win. Miller, broke the small bone of his right arm, and the bone had not time to knit firmly. Taylor knew this all along and stopped his friends from betting that he would win. Taylor did go through a course of what he called training—that is, he reduced himself from 214 to 194 pounds, but he did not harden and strengthen his muscles as he should have done. Therefore, with these obstacles to overcome, he had no chance of standing up against the sledge-hammer blows of such an experienced pugilist as Dwyer, but with a strict course of training and his arm as strong as it used to be, Taylor could enter the arena against Dwyer, and the contest would be an obstinate and protracted struggle. Dwyer went into the match with Taylor with a determination to do all he could to win. He looked upon Taylor as a determined, thorough boxer, and knew he had no easy match without he trained and worked hard. He trained into condition, and he was, on last Monday night, capable of disputing the right of anybody aspiring for the championship.\n\nHe wore spiked shoes, which gave him a great advantage over Taylor, as the latter would slip at every blow he would make. Today, Joe Coburn, in a dispute with Taylor, said: “You cannot fight; neither can Johnny Dwyer. I can whip you, and I can whip Dwyer. Neither he nor you are any good, and both of you have a heap to learn if you ever fight in the ring.” Taylor replied that he was ready to fight anybody, and he would declare himself after he saw his friends. It is probable the affair will end in a regular match for $1,000 a side, being arranged between the rivals, Joe Coburn, Johnny Dwyer, and Steve Taylor. Brooklyn sporting men are almost frantic over Dwyer's performances, and they offer to match him, now that he has entered the arena, to fight any man in the world for $1,000 a side and upward. Joe Coburn can get matched to fight anybody for any amount as soon as he is ready to fight.\n\nGeorge Rooke is quietly awaiting to get on a match with someone, while Tom Allen of St. Louis, who holds the title of champion of America, is anxiously awaiting the arrival of Jem Mace, and if that noted bruiser does not soon come over, Allen will be looking for a match to gain fresh laurels. Johnny Dwyer beat Tom Allen several years ago in a contest in Central Hall, Bowery. Allen has not forgotten that event, and it would just suit Allen to arrange a match with the Brooklyn giant to try and rub out that reverse. In the meantime, Taylor, not at all satisfied with the result on Monday night, states that he is ready to arrange a match against any man in America but Tom Allen, to fight at catch weight, according to the rules of the London prize ring, for $1,000 a side, the fight to take place within 500 miles of New York next April. No doubt either Johnny Dwyer, Joe Coburn, or George Rooke may accept the challenge.\n\nFrom present indications, there promises to be a lively time in pugilistic circles.\n\nA communication has been received by The News from Boston, which reads as follows:\n\n\"SHARVARD STREET, BOSTON, Jan. 25.—Having witnessed the glove contest between John Dwyer and Steve Taylor, in your city, on Monday, oblige me by publishing the following in the sporting column of The Daily News: I will match Prof. Tom Denny, of this city, to a glove contest upon the same conditions as the recent contest between Taylor and Dwyer, except that the contest is to last one hour instead of thirty minutes. The stakes are to be $250 or $500 a side. The contest is to take place at this city or in New York in four or six weeks. A reply will be promptly attended to. Address ‘Glovist,’ in care of John Shea, Boston.”"

Rigal will doubtless throw Carteron the first round, but then, he hasn't got the wind to stand up to three best in five.\n\nRep.—Is there much money passing hands on the result, and who is the favorite?\n\nTom—I think there is considerable money being put up, because I hold over $600 in stakes now. Rigal is generally the favorite by five to four.\n\nRep.—Do you know any ring news?\n\nTom—Not as much as I'd like to. About the only thing going on in that line now are newspaper squibs.\n\nRep.—How about Jem Mace? Has he postponed his visit to America, and what is he doing?\n\nTom—Jem Mace has never intended to come to America to do any fighting. He is tending to his menagerie and giving sparring exhibitions, telling the English that he has challenged me and that I wouldn’t fight him.\n\nRep.—I thought you had retired from the prize ring.\n\nTom—So I have, but then I'll not stand bullying. If Jem Mace or anybody else thinks they can whip me, let 'em stick the stamps; I'll cover any amount. There are a few newspaper champions in New York that I'd like to get a chance at, but none of 'em feel disposed to bet any of their wealth on their muscle. I have only retired from the ring until opportunity is offered for me to get back in; or if someone feels a pressing desire to take the champion’s belt from me.

Donnelly, therefore, went straight to Justice Walton's office and had all of Tom's trunks attached for a debt of $125. Now, when Tom heard of this, he was not pleased, and he told a very different story of his relations with Donnelly. Among other things, he left word with a police officer to have Donnelly arrested for carrying off a coat alleged not to belong to him.

    text: "This morning Tom Allen, the pugilist, called at the Dispatch office and asked that he be set right as to the libelous reports in circulation against him the past few days to the effect that he was going to jump the town and go to England. Tom's statement is as follows: “After my engagement at the Theatre Comique, I made a similar engagement for one week with the manager of the Adelphi Theater to go with Donnelly and give sparring exhibitions, and I was prepared to fulfill my engagement until Tuesday morning last, when I had trouble with Donnelly. Donnelly, whose real name is George Bruer, I took from the streets some months since where he was getting but $1.25 a day as a laborer, clothed him, and put him in training. After continuous labor, I made a clever boxer of him—provided him with money whenever he wanted it, lodged and boarded him, and treated him as a gentleman. On Tuesday morning he came downstairs from over my late saloon on Washington Avenue, where he slept, and got money from behind the bar and went to breakfast. Returning, he left a note for me saying, 'I have played Irishman long enough.' I asked him what he meant; he told me he had something better in view. I asked him if he was going to go back on his engagement with me to go to Chicago after all I had done for him, when he sneered at me and I knocked him down, and he lay where he fell and cried like a woman. He got up when he found I was not going to tap him again; went off and had my trunks attached for $125. This was done, you see, to get my traps, so I could not fulfill my engagement at Chicago. But after some trouble, I got everything fixed all right and will go to Chicago, fill my engagement, and return here on the 25th.\n\nHow about going to England?\n\nWell, that is a bloody lie, for I had no more intention than you have of going to the old country. Do you think I would go from St. Louis, where I have lived seven years? No; I intend to live in St. Louis. That story was gotten up by Bruer alias Donnelly and Billy Allen, of the St. Louis Adelphi. You see Allen wanted me to go to his theater and spar with Joe Coburn, but I wouldn’t spar with that dirty blackguard, for when I was in New York he refused to spar with me, and I couldn't get a New Yorker to “put up” before me. When Billy Allen found I wouldn’t have anything to do with Coburn, he got around Bruer alias Donnelly, and prevailed upon him to break with me. You see that’s what caused the trouble, and Billy Allen has been keeping it up as an advertisement for his place.\n\nBut Tom, a correspondent in the Globe-Democrat this morning intimates that you are skipping out to avoid meeting Coburn. How's that?\n\nWhy should I skip out to avoid Coburn? Joe Coburn has no more intention of fighting me than I have of jumping off the Court House. I have given Coburn every chance a man could give but he won’t fight me, and I authorize the Dispatch to state that while I am gone, I have made arrangements with Fred Watkins, my backer, of 720 Main Street, to accept any challenge Coburn or his friends may offer for $500 a side or more, and if they mean business, the money will be up in two hours. I wouldn’t want any better sport than to get Joe Coburn out of the bounds of the law in the Indian Territory, for instance, where a fight a week without being molested.\n\nThere is a statement to the effect that the constable closed you up?\n\nWell, that too, is a bloody lie. The lease on the place I had expired and as they are going to tear down the old house and rebuild, of course, I had to get out, but I am looking for another place. My goods were not sold as stated, but are stored at 1222 Collins Street. This scoundrel Bruer and my enemies got up these stories out of spite against me. They won't fight me and take this means of doing me hurt.\n\nTom's bartender, James Garvin, corroborated this statement, and said he never heard the champion say he was going to England. Tom expressed his thanks to the reporter, and said any messages sent to the Dispatch would be recognized by him."

A well-known sporting man says it is idle to talk of Allen’s leaving St. Louis to avoid meeting Joe Coburn, or any other pugilist who may come to town.\n\nJem Mace, in a letter to Coburn, says Joe Goss, who is up in New York, came over on a special mission to fight Allen. Tom’s friends scout the idea that he will not meet Goss, and whip him too. Everything indicates that a big “mill” is in prospect, and that the St. Louis champion will not show the “white feather,” but give Goss a fair fight for love or money.\n\nThe following dispatch was received at this office at 2 o’clock today:\n\nCHICAGO, April 17\n\nCity Editor of the St. Louis Dispatch:\n\nI learn that Joe Goss is not in this country, as reported. This story was gotten up by Joe Coburn and his friends. Say through the DISPATCH for me, that I will fight Coburn with the gloves for all the money he can get.\n\n(Signed) TOM ALLEN.\n\nIt is very evident the champion has not “cut sticks” as many would believe, but is on hand and ready to make good what he says. Coburn stated in an interview on Saturday with a DISPATCH man, that he would not again enter the prize ring, but as he is going about the country representing himself as the champion boxer, and that Allen is not a second-class man with the gloves, here is a clearly stated proposition from Tom, which Joe can take notice of without breaking his word.\n\nA DISPATCH reporter made a vigorous search for Mr. Coburn, and it was not until a full hour had been so spent that the gentleman was found. Calling Mr. C. aside, the reporter handed him the above dispatch from Allen to read. He hastily glanced at the paper, and then said: “I have no answer to make; this is only one of Allen's advertising dodges, and I don’t propose to be made a fool of. If he wants the satisfaction he so profusely affirms that he is in search of, let him come to St. Louis and I'll fight him for fun and without gloves. I don't want to render myself subject to arrest, and Allen well knows that we would be arrested should we spar for money. I can’t entertain Allen's proposition, for I know that he doesn’t mean business. It is strange indeed that he should leave St. Louis at the very time he was expecting me here, if he really had any desire to spar with me. When Allen means business he will take the proper course to let me know it, and not until then will I notice such advertisements.”",

He said that he had had no communication with Allen personally, and if that gentleman should address him on the subject of an encounter, he would say nothing else than he has said through the papers. In other words, Coburn will have nothing to do with Allen, either bare-fisted or with gloves. Coburn leaves Monday morning for Chicago to fill an engagement of one week at the Coliseum, where he will act in a bruiser play with the Hanlon brothers. Tom Allen will be in this city by Monday, so as to swap places there will be little chance of a mill of any kind.

    text: "The much talked of wrestling match between Prof. Thiebaud Bauer, the champion of America, and Herr Julius Schroeder, proprietor of the saloon known as \"Section 11\" of this city, came off last night according to announcement at the Temple, before a well-filled house. Both men were in good condition, Bauer weighing 176 pounds, and Schroeder 243; the former confident and the latter hopeful.\n\nAt half-past eight o’clock Tom Allen made his appearance on the stage, accompanied by Arthur Chambers and Billy Edwards, the light-weight champions, whom he introduced to the audience. They arrived in the city yesterday morning, and are billed for a benefit at the Adelphi theatre on Thursday evening next.\n\nThe pugilists then retired and the wrestlers came forward, Bauer first and Schroeder next, accompanied by their umpires, Mr. Frank Printz for Schroeder and Billy Edwards for Bauer. They were greeted with cheers. Tom Allen then stated that he had been chosen referee, and would fill the position to the best of his ability. He then called \"Time,\" and the men advanced towards each other and began the struggle.\n\nThe first bout, by agreement, was according to the German style, which permits of no back holds and no neck locks. This bout lasted 14 minutes and was won by Bauer, who showed throughout his thorough mastery of his profession, taking matters as coolly and as easily as his burly antagonist would let him, and yet being always on the alert whenever he saw an advantage to be gained. Schroeder, after a few minutes' work, began to puff and blow, and the perspiration rolled from his face. He found that he had before him no plaything, and that, with all his giant strength, he had to exert himself to the utmost if he hoped to win. After several ineffectual efforts he managed to get his right arm round Bauer's waist, and then his left, when both men struggled fiercely for a few moments towards the right wings. Bauer broke the grip, but was soon afterwards seized in the same manner and forced to his knees, when Schroeder secured the best hold of the bout, grasping Bauer around the waist sideways and lifting him off the stage; but in doing so, the latter, with a good deal of strategy and no less activity, broke loose from him, amid the applause of the audience. Bauer then got a waist grip on Schroeder, raised him from the ground, and followed up his advantage by throwing him on his knees. It looked to the audience as if he ought to have still wrestled with him, but the rules of the German style require that when one man is on his knees the other shall allow him to arise. This Bauer did. He then allowed Schroeder to get a good shoulder grip, rested a few seconds, and then, exerting all his strength, turned Schroeder over his shoulder to the ground, where he threw his weight on him and forced both of his shoulders to touch the carpet. There was considerable cheering at this display.\n\nA fifteen minutes’ recess was then taken to allow the men to cool off. Bauer stated to a Republican reporter during the intermission that Schroeder was a much stronger man than Heygster, but that strength alone could not win in such an encounter.\n\nThe second bout, which was according to fair catch rules, lasted only six minutes, and was quite hotly contested. Schroeder, acting under the advice of his friends, who told him to work quickly and force the fun, went at Bauer impetuously at first; but the latter seemed to play with him, and the audience, seeing this, enjoyed the sport. Bauer permitted Schroeder to seize him almost any way he pleased, and just as he was about to throw him, Bauer would quickly force himself free. As this was too monotonous, however, Bauer put in a little work. He got a savage neck lock on Schroeder and squeezed his head under his left arm until the latter groaned with pain, but could not break the lock. With this hold Bauer raised him in his arms and swung him around the stage, finally throwing him from him. Schroeder seemed annoyed at this and the laughter which the audience indulged in, added to his discomfort. He fought desperately for a good hold, but could not obtain one. Suddenly Bauer terminated the bout by raising Schroeder in his arms by a waist grip from behind, throwing him on the carpet and falling on his chest, so that both shoulders touched. Time, six minutes and a half.\n\nThis terminated the match in favor of Bauer, who was called out twice and rapturously applauded."

    text: "The fight between Tom Allen of St. Louis and Joe Goss of London, announced for today, began this morning about 7:33 at a point near Walton, Ky., on the Louisville Short Line railroad, 18 miles from Cincinnati. Some six or seven hundred persons were in attendance, including prominent fighting men and roughs from all the large cities of the Union, mixed with a sprinkling of sporting men, a few merchants, and professional men from Cincinnati, St. Louis, Louisville, and the West.\n\nAllen seemed to have few friends—even those from St. Louis appeared to be against him; indeed, the only men, with few exceptions, who chose or dared to express opinions in his favor were in great part those not in any way connected with the ring or sporting life. Particularly was this to be remarked among the roughs from New York and the East. Allen's wordy contests with Coburn, Rooke, O'Baldwin, and others have made him irreconcilable enemies who are as dangerous as they are noisy.\n\nThe English fighting men, with few exceptions, are against him. A man never went into a ring with more enemies, and a man less game than Allen would never have dared to do so. His nonchalance is remarkable. It is almost fatalism, and while there is very little doubt that he is good enough to beat two Gosses in the same ring, it is more than doubtful if he will be permitted by the New York school of roughs to do so.\n\nDespite this feeling, a general undercurrent of admiration for the man’s pluck is manifested. Very few expect Goss to win, but there is confidence that he will be able to make a strong rough fight of it for an hour, trusting to the chapter of accidents for a chance blow like that which Gallagher gave to Allen and defeated him, or to a foul blow and the decision of the referee, or as a last resource to a general break-up of the ring and stealing the fight out of Allen’s hands in this way.\n\nThe fight as that the sun has risen on a desperate mob of high-toned roughs, eager for blood. If all other ruses fail to stop the fight, in the event of its going in favor of the St. Louis man, a cry of police or militia will be raised, and then will come a stampede.\n\nThe ring is pitched in a smooth patch of clover, and all is promising as could well be for a fight or a foot-race—on the outside. It would be a good place for a camp-meeting. This isn’t a camp-meeting by a large majority.\n\nThe men entered the ring. The roar for Goss was like the going-off of a small park of artillery, as he shied his castor inside the ropes. Allen also received a share of applause, but there was comparatively little heart in it. Both men smiled pleasantly and retired to corners, where the process of the toilet was commenced.\n\nThe toss for corners having been decided, the business of the day was fairly in order. At 7:35, the men with their seconds advanced to the center of the ring. This part of a fight is imposing and has in it a certain air of chivalry which, however, is dispelled the next moment. The principals grasp hands, and the four seconds shake hands across their extended arms. The seconds then retire to their respective corners, and the men are left standing facing each other, eager for the fray.\n\nBoth men have paid fair attention to their training—as Allen always does—but Goss looks seedy and aged to a keen observer, notwithstanding all that has been done for him. The marks of a rough life are visible on his battle-worn face, but there is a care-devil force about the man that inspires confidence in his backers. He is serious and perhaps a little nervous, for it is his first fight in America, and he has a desperate contract before him. Allen is in fine form, clear of skin and eyes, and like a rock on his finely rounded legs, which are models for a sculptor. Altogether the comparison is in favor of Allen.\n\nROUND ONE.\n\nThe men, left to themselves, eye each other eagerly and watchfully. The positions of both men are good, that of Goss being perhaps the more artistic of the two, in a pugilistic sense. He reminds some of the old ring-goers of Tom Sayers in position, but the comparison ends there. Both men sparred cautiously and worked round for an opening. Tiresome for the crowd. At last, Allen led off and clinched. They fell in Allen’s corner with Goss on top. First blood allowed for Allen. Time seven minutes.\n\nROUND SECOND.\n\nBoth men came up quickly and smiling. Goss evidently serious and Allen anxious to get to work and bustle his man. Tom spars quickly and cross counters on Goss’ lip slightly in reply to one or two heavily on his ribs from Goss’ left. Goss staggers and bleeds, and in the wrestle falls under.\n\nROUND THIRD.\n\nClose in-fighting, all in Allen’s favor, and Goss under at the finish. The Gossites roaring.\n\nROUND FOURTH.\n\nBoth men get to work at once. Exchanges are fast and furious. Allen gets in a terrible blow on Goss’ neck, which knocks him clean off his legs. Time three minutes. Good fighting, but all in favor of the champion.\n\nROUND FIFTH.\n\nThe pace is telling on both. Sparring for wind. Allen, as usual, leads off at Goss’ face, but falls short, and in return receives a terrific blow in the stomach, which ought to have sickened him. Tom grins horribly and looks wickedly green about the eyes. He steadies himself for a moment and then delivers his left heavily on the body, and his right by a cross hit on Goss’ damaged eye, which exhibits signs of the early closing movement. Goss won’t be denied, bores his way in, gets in one or two lightly on Allen’s body, and then they get to sharp half-arm hitting, in which Allen has all the best of it. His blows have more steam in them, and the condition of the men is telling. Goss goes down to avoid punishment.\n\nROUND SIXTH.\n\nBoth come up quickly and active. No positive damage done yet, but the fight all for Allen, barring a foul which the crowd is eagerly looking for. Allen gets in viciously on Goss’ head, which he repents, being countered slightly on the cheek. Allen repeats, and again sends in another hot one on the damaged optic. A desperate rally and in-fighting, and Goss is finally fought down. This was the best round in the fight. Nothing can save the fight to Goss except a stroke of lightning, the police, or the roughs.\n\nROUND SEVENTH.\n\nOn time being called, the men stood up in their corners, but the Covington Light Guard made their appearance at the ring side, and the fight was stopped. A hasty flight is in progress, and it is believed that the fight will be renewed as soon as a place of safety can be reached."

    text: "Tom Allen is out on bail. A writ of habeas corpus was issued by Judge Perkins, of the Kenton Criminal Court, Covington, yesterday morning, on petition of the prisoner, who stated that the bail fixed by the Covington Mayor was unreasonable and exorbitant, and Allen was taken before the Judge by the jailor, in obedience to this writ.\n\nThe Commonwealth’s attorney, Judge Cleary, resisted the application on the ground that the defense had not offered sufficient evidence to support the plea of exorbitancy. In view of the fact that the bail was disproportioned to the offense and its punishment, and that the bail to the amount of $3,000 had been offered, the court reduced the bail to the latter sum. Messrs. D.D. Farrell and Wilson J. Farrell were accepted as sureties, and Allen was released. He left Covington for Cincinnati in a carriage with three of his friends.\n\nIt was interesting to observe the curiosity of the people on the streets when Allen's carriage appeared in Cincinnati. As the French Nation stood agape while Louis Fourteenth put on his small clothes, so waiting stood crowds in the streets staring with admiration while the mistreated prize-fighter went through the simple operation of shaking hands with a friend, or of slaking his thirst in a convenient drinking place. After making the tour of the hotels, the hero of the moment dropped into a saloon on Vine street, near Fourth street. The patient spectators waited and gossiped until he reappeared.\n\nLate in the evening Allen and his friends returned to the central part of the city from a drive. The prize-fighter was the prominent figure in every group which gathered about him. He was in the best of humor, and was inclined to treat his late discomforts rather humorously than otherwise.\n\nThe few injuries he received in the fight are now barely perceptible. A slight mark on the upper lip is all that remains of what was called at the time an ugly cut. The right hand is somewhat swollen yet, but shows scarcely another trace of the wound which disfigured it.\n\nHe had been told six weeks ago that he could not win the fight, and had asked his informant then if Eph. Holland was not square in his dealings. He had received an answer then in the negative, but did not credit it until he saw how the whole business was managed. As for the story that Holland had put up all the money, he allowed that such might have been the case with Goss, but Goss and Allen were two different persons. He had put up his own money, and supposed it was a matter of friendship on Holland's part when the latter offered to place $500 of the stakes. He had accepted the offer as an act of friendship, but had no doubt now that it was his own money which had been put up against him. Thus, his money, staked for a fair fight, had been made to do double duty.\n\nHe expressed confidence that those who had victimized him would be remembered for their dishonesty. In a fair fight he claimed that he could have whipped his opponent in half an hour, and added that he had fought with less vigor for the very reason that he saw the crowd to be against him, and desired to show them that he was really master of the field, and would not win his victory by a trick.",

    text: "Your correspondent accompanied the Goss party to the grounds, a beautiful, sequestered spot, three miles below Walton Station, on the Frankfort Road, eighteen miles below Cincinnati. Allen, with Kelley and Chambers, his seconds, were on the grounds, and at 6:20 two special trains arrived with as rough a gang of raisers as ever attended a mill.\n\nIn disembarking several rows occurred between the St. Louis party and the New York crowd. The New Yorkers were fussing to make a match for John Dwyer with anyone or with the winner. The Gypsy Jem Mace was called upon to take up the talker, but he smilingly refused.\n\nEph. Holland and the seconds were not long in finding the spot for the battle, choosing a piece of ground of slight elevation above the railroad. At 7 o'clock both men were in the ring and the crowd was surging through the clover field, and \"pawing\" the ropes. Eph Holland deputized two men as \"Knucklers\" to keep the crowd from crowding the \"corners.\" Many of the spectators took to the trees and haystacks. Goss was first to shy his \"castor\" into the ring. Allen followed in a quarter of an hour. Both men were loudly applauded. Allen kicked up the grass and remarked to Goss, rather soft, to which Goss smiled good-naturedly.\n\nAfter several prominent pugilists had declined the position of referee, Eph Holland was induced to accept. Jack Brown was chosen umpire for Goss and Dad Ryan for Allen. Tom Kelly and George Chambers were seconds for Allen; Barney Aaron and Johnny Dwyer seconded Goss.\n\nFirst Round.—Both men shook hands and \"put up.\" Both came up splendidly. Guards nearly same, Allen if anything a trifle lower. Sparring cautiously, moving about, Allen swinging around to Goss' corner, and then advancing matters on Joe, when Allen got in a smeller. First blood claimed and allowed for Allen. The men took the ring and Allen went down with Goss on top. Time, 7 minutes.\n\nSecond Round.—The men began less cautiously and Allen, evidently determined to force matters, let fly a liner with his left and caught Goss on the \"potato trap,\" cutting his under lip and shaking him in his pins, in return for which Allen was the recipient of some powerful body blows, when the men clinched and fell, Allen on top. Time, 4 minutes.\n\nThird Round.—Work began promptly at the call of time, the men meeting in the middle of the ring, Goss laying in some beauties on Allen’s body, receiving in return some staggering head thumps, the round closing with Goss to grass. Time, 5 minutes.\n\nAt this time a cry of \"cops\" was raised, and a rush was made by the crowd, when the Covington Light Guards and another militia company appeared on the scene, but the cry, \"On with the fight,\" was raised, and the next round was called.\n\nFourth Round—Opened with terrific hitting: Goss’ mouth was bleeding badly, and a blue knoll in the neighborhood of his right eye did not add to his beauty. Allen was clear-skinned except in the body. Tom, in this round, forced the music, and got in a swinging blow on Goss’ neck, knocking him off his pins. Time, 3 minutes.\n\nFifth Round—The men evidently were nervous about the \"melish,\" and sparred rapidly. Allen leading off sent a short stinger on Goss’ face and was complimented by Joe with a tremendous punch in the breadbasket. Some splendid counter blows followed, Allen giving a tremendous \"sag\" on Goss’ body, and swinging his terrible right stopped it on Goss’ dazed peeper. Close fighting ensued at half-arm distance, both men taking the \"thump\" like Trojans, when Goss went down to avoid the terrible punishment Allen was getting in on his face.\n\nSixth Round—The men came up to the scratch, Allen smiling, and Goss exhibiting an uneasiness. Allen forced matters without waiting, and sent in a liner, catching Joe on the cheek and repeated. Again Goss’ face got another stinging blow.\n\nSeventh Round—Time was called, the men coming up promptly, when the Captain of the Covington Light Guards put in an appearance and declared the fight must cease. Eph. Holland expostulated in a musing manner, but the Kentucky officer would not listen. And Eph. was compelled to announce his willingness to obey the laws of the state—\"I am a man of peace,\" said the Rev. Eph, \"and am opposed to the illegal shedding of blood.\" This remark was received with yells and cheers, and Barney Aaron announced the entertainment over until after refreshments.\n\nGreat dissatisfaction was expressed at the termination of the battle, and some satisfaction was demanded. Eph. Holland assured the \"gang\" that he would have the men renew the battle today; that they had all come to see the fight and he would not disappoint them. The crowd is now boarding the train.\n\nThe crowd is adjourning to another place to have the fight fought out. The fight as far as it has progressed is all in favor of Allen. He was whipping Goss terribly.\n\nAfter the breaking of the ring by the militia at Rodemacher’s farm, the crowd moved down a distance of seven or eight miles and at 10 o'clock and 8 minutes pitched a ring at a spot between Sparta and Walton.\n\nAt 10:15 the ring is being formed amidst much excitement. Allen and Goss are both on the train which they took after the breaking up of the first ring by the Covington militia.\n\nThe crowd is growing ugly, and insists upon the battle being fought out, and will no doubt resist the militia should they interfere.\n\nSo far as the battle has progressed Allen has had a decided advantage. Goss has been marked considerably, while Allen has not a scratch. Allen gained both the first blood and knockdown.\n\nAt 10:45 everything is in readiness, and the referee has called for the men to again appear. The probabilities are that the fight will be concluded at this point.\n\nEighth Round—After the ring had been arranged, word was sent to the two men. Goss was first to respond to the summons. He had a blotch over the right eye, and showed some slight signs of the punishment received during the morning. After some sparring Allen got in on Goss’ face and drew blood. Goss countered on Allen's body, then there was a clinch and Goss fell.\n\nNinth Round—After considerable sparring Allen got squarely on Goss' nose. Allen got in on Goss’ breast, and Goss on Allen’s face. Goss seems to be feeling his punishment, and his left eye is nearly closed. The round closed by Allen fighting Goss down.\n\nTenth Round—After rapid exchanges, the men clinched in Allen's corner and were separated by the referee.\n\nEleventh Round—Fighting sharp and furious and in favor of Allen. The men go down at the ropes. Goss’ eyes are rapidly closing.\n\nTwelfth Round—Goss forced the fighting, and a low blow was struck. A claim of foul was made but not allowed. The round was decided in Allen's favor, Goss commences to show his punishment badly. Allen has received some heavy body blows.",

    text: "From the time that Tom Allen, the champion of the prize ring, left his home in this city some few months ago to go into training prior to meeting the Englishman Goss in the squared circle, the eyes of St. Louis have been upon him with no little degree of interest. Even the bloated bondholder and the avaricious merchant have found time to read the \"Allen and Goss\" news, and it is even rumored that the news of the fight was read quietly by certain of the clergy who repaired secretly to nooks in their parsonages, where they could count the rounds as they were fought, and then muse over the depravity of human nature and prepare themselves for the next Sunday's sermon, and take for their text, \"How sweet and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.\"\n\nThis morning the train from Cincinnati brought in the man who had whipped Joe Goss, but who was euchred out of the stakes by a preconcerted action of a band of ruffians. Soon after his arrival in the city, Tom took a bath, changed his linen, and straightway proceeded to the saloon of Tom Kelly, No. 9 North Ninth Street, and shook hands with about the only boy who stood by him through all the vicissitudes of that Kentucky fight. The argus eyes of the Dispatch reporter were not long in finding out Tom. He found the pugilist looking better, physically, than he had ever seen him before. The closely shorn hair is beginning to crop out, and the handsome mustache that Tom used to wear, which had been shaven off for the fight, is again peeping out from his upper lip. At present, Allen will kick the scales at 180 avoirdupois.\n\nThere is not a scar on his face, and were it not for a blue mark or two about the body, no one would ever know that he had had a tussle with the champion of England. Tom says that never has a pugilist in this country or the other one ever received such an ovation as did he at Cincinnati from the citizens of that place. He says that Goss hurried away as soon as he could for New York, and that ere this, or soon, he will be putting the ocean between himself and the United States as fast as a steamer can carry him. He says further that there is no truth in the newspaper report that the Governor of Kentucky had issued a requisition for Goss from New York. Allen reiterates his former assertion, never again to enter the ring. He says to win in the prize-ring of today a man must take his chances with thieves and duffers."

    text: "Tom Allen, the pugilist, who resided in St. Louis for over ten years, during which time he gained the title of Champion of America by his prowess in the squared circle, has recently turned up in London, and, according to newspaper reports, is as ready now to face an opponent as he was some years since when he met and conquered Davis, McCoole, Jones, Gallagher, and other doughty knights of the ring. Though Allen left this region under somewhat of a cloud, owing mostly to unfortunate business ventures, he left behind him a host of warm friends and ardent admirers whose interest in the champion and his movements is still deep-felt and anxious. Knowing that everything appertaining to him would be of more than ordinary interest, a DISPATCH reporter has taken some pains to investigate the facts in regard to the reported forthcoming mill between Allen and Tompkins Gilbert, who is styled the champion of England.\n\nTom Kelly being considered the most orthodox authority in matters of this kind, our reporter called upon him at his saloon, No. 11 North Sixth street, where he found Kelly amusing himself with three fine bull terrier dogs, which had just been received from New York, and at once inquired what he knew about Gilbert and his record in the ring.\n\nKelly—Well, I don’t believe that fellow has any record. You see, it’s been some time since I was over in the old country, and that man wasn’t known in my time; and though I keep a pretty good run of such matters, I’ve never heard of Gilbert putting up his hands before any man in a fight.\n\nRep.—But, Tom, a New Yorker says that—\n\nKelly—How much does it say Gilbert weighs?\n\nRep.—Eleven stone, and he is over six feet high.\n\nKelly—(After a moment's reflection)—Eleven stone, eh? Well, Tom Allen can whip him. But see here, that match for £50 a side is not for a regular out-and-out fight in the ring.\n\nRep.—No! What is it then?\n\nKelly—Why, Tompkins Gilbert is said to be the champion sparrer of England, and this match is to be a sparring match. Both men have their hands blackened, so that every blow given leaves its mark, and at the expiration of the agreed time, say half an hour, or an hour, the one who has delivered the most blows upon his adversary is declared the winner.\n\nRep.—Then it ain’t a fair stand-up take and give fight?\n\nKelly—Oh, no. But it's almost as hard on the men, for it tests their skill and is a severe strain upon their powers of endurance.\n\nRep.—Well, Tom, to change the subject a little, those are mighty ferocious-looking dogs. Going to have some work for the brutes, eh?\n\nKelly—Oh, no; nothing of that kind. They belong to some New York parties who are going to open a school shortly where terriers can be taught to catch rats. That's all. Good day. Come again and see the pups."

    text: "Tom Allen has been in training about a week now and has reduced some of his incipient approaches to aldermanic abdominal rotundity. Near the banks of that river that has been more sung, and more muddy, than any driblet of water on the top of this doubted round globe, at Barnet, on the Thames, is the gallant Tom in training, and undergoing \"a course of sprouts\" from his \"Coach\" Jack Hopkins. Tom \"peels\" well and shows up a fine, glossy, clear, cutaneous coat. His ease, elasticity, and arm glance are manifestly fine—I may say, to quote \"all England\"—the most slangy nation of creation—that he is \"all there\" and \"quite fit\" as well as \"in form.\" He stands well and firm and would delight Charles Reade, the most insane psychological novelist, in illustrations of freedom of his \"left hand.\"\n\nHis power of opposition is in \"fine form,\" and would draw tears of admiration from that one tearful eye of Picayune Butler, or cause that much cared for and well-nursed mustache of doubtful honest proportions—that cheeky mustache—of General Logan to stand on end, each very particular hair, like the fretted quills of an enraged porcupine.\n\nTom Allen, so well known to all of your sporting readers—and, by the by, he sends a general greeting to Cincinnati—is well in hand and will be ready for the conquest, the belt, and the money too, in the course of fourteen or sixteen days hence. He is smooth all over in finish—in fact, I may say he is pugilistically oleomargarined, from head to foot, and would set George Francis Train in a fit of Monotheistic ecstasy, only removable by an animated anagoge supplemented with a five-cent repast of undefinable hash. Tom Allen stands about 5 feet 9, and weighs what in England is termed fourteen stone—a weight that conveys only blank to the ordinary American mind, but which means 196 pounds. When he \"opens his ports\" and goes into action he will be barely 10 pounds, if that weight. He is a medium brunette, and \"not so bad as he seems,\" being kind and grateful of heart.\n\nCharley Davis is a little lump of a man, with immense confidence, indeed, as much assurance, as possessed by the \"Count Joannes\" or his friend \"Lord Dundreary.\" Davis is about five feet five, well-knit frame, and 184 pounds in weight, with some ability, and immoderate \"cheek.\" He is training under Johns, his old trainer, and \"sniff the breeze afar\" at Reigate. I have not had a good look at him yet to be able to speak particularly of his forte. He is rather fair in complexion, well up in \"box,\" but alongside of Allen stands in the relation of a Cincinnati lamp-post to an electric light, between 12 and 4 o'clock, when typos and city councilmen return from their arduous labors and municipal suppers of a dark wintry night.\n\nWhat has induced Davis to a fistic encounter with Allen is beyond my ken, unless it be finances. Tom will walk over the boards like a St. Louis paper and the New York Home Journal do over their remnants of conscience in pilfering our matter and never acknowledging it. Davis will be dished up like a turkey with sauce à la Russe. I refrain from saying more, as one has to indulge in some of the maxims of Macbeth:\n\n\"Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons.\"\n\nBut one thing I am compelled to say, and that is, that Davis, as an original artist, is about the smallest one I have seen, with the largest amount of conceit—something like the last penny Echo newspaper here and the proprietor of that more original paper, Truth, Mr. Labouchere.\n\nWhen these contestants for the \"championship,\" the £200 and more beside, meet at St. George's Hall—should they meet, for the \"law\" has a great deal to do in the matter—I will tell you how they loomed up, went down, and retired into private life—or a public house. A public house in London is a varied rendezvous. You will find the John Thomas of flunkies, straight from Albert Grant's house that Mr. Mackay has not purchased, and never intended to purchase, with its seven acres of gardens and its western distance of one and a half miles from Piccadilly, all costing over £500,000, cheek by jowl with a \"Funeral-Mute,\" a baker and a sweep, a broken-down actor and ex-prize fighter. The history of a legal house in London would afford a theme for a novel well worthy the attention of the London correspondent of the New York Times.\n\nNext to the humbug of seeing an over-dressed woman with sixteen button gloves on, handing a three-cent piece (112½ grains) into the plate at church, for the benefit of widows and orphans, is seeing two men strip and maul each other like a pair of enraged members of Congress with the insane agitation of two rickety windmills on the marshes of Amsterdam. I read on endless walls, and in numerous newspapers, of \"a grand assault of arms\" under distinguished patronage, at the Royal Surrey Gardens Theater, on March 12; admission 1s. I bought my ticket and got in my \"Hansom,\" and drove over to witness this much talked-of and advertised display of foils, fencing, single-stick by the Otterway troupe; boxing by Tommy Hawkins and Punch Dowsett for a real silver medal (no electro); wrestling by Jemmy Highland, a champion of Birmingham, and finally the grand scene of Denny Harrington boxing George Rooke for the cup of claret. I say I went. I say I left. I regret the one was so soon and the other so late. Jack Hicks and Jack Baldock had the care and nursing of Harrington; Jem Dillon and George Probert, of Birmingham, had the bringing up of Rooke.\n\nTo many of the Enquirer's readers Rooke is well known. He is the brother of the celebrated boxer, Jack Rooke, and in that alone may claim any \"laurels\" he aims to wear in the prize ring. He is thirty-eight years of age and five feet eleven and one-half inches high, fully. By trade he is a gunmaker, and to that he should remain a faithful son. In America he proved his ability in that mechanism, and might have made a fortune if the \"fancy\" did not entice him away, and his \"scrappings\" lead him into devious paths. He fought Tom Hussey at Boston for $300 and \"Perquis\" the first year of his landing in America, and he vanquished Hussey, but with \"no margins to carry over,\" as less chivalrous champions of the Stock Exchange say. He next tackled C. Collins, of the city of London, then in America also, for $1,000, and after some tough time of it, in one hour and twenty-five minutes the little game ended in a \"foul,\" Collins being knocked into \"smithereens.\" It was said, but I won't say how correctly, that \"Boss\" E. Corker had crookedly \"squared\" the affair. After this, Rooke had a little deal with a card named Mat Moore for $2,000 and the middle-weight championship. Moore was a \"puffed up\" pug, and in one hour and four minutes came to grief and cried \"Turkey\" plain. Then Rooke took to Jack Smith, of them in a private vis-a-vis for $500 and in twenty minutes, or six rounds, Jack went into a camera obscura, his \"photo\" being spoiled for an Adonis. Rooke, by this time, went rejoicing on his way from New York to Chicago and St. Louis, and back to Cincinnati, etc., like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour. Many of your readers will recall the great excitement and general \"bobbery\" at Spa Lake, Wilkesbarre, Penn., when Rooke stepped out of the cars one fine morning to meet Jem Coyne for $2,000 and to the amazement of all the said Jem sat on his haunches in the ring and stubbornly declined to move or fight."

    text: "St. Louis was once recognized throughout the United States as the head center of that class of sporting men known as pugilists. Here Tom Allen made his headquarters for many years, and in the days between 1859 and 1873, was looked upon as the rightful claimant to the title of champion. His popular establishment on Washington Avenue was a favorite resort of these knights of the fancy, and no true fighting man, in those days, passed through St. Louis without calling at Tom's place, for the purpose of shaking the brawny hand of the plucky Englishman, and drinking the \"alt and 'alf\" which flowed in streams from the silver faucets which adorned Tom's counter.\n\nMcCoole's saloon on Wash Street was also well known, and for a while well patronized; at one time the muscular proprietor was said to be worth a good round sum of money, but after his disastrous defeats by Allen, friends left his resort to patronize that of his antagonist and conqueror, Allen. McCoole lost his money and friends faster than he made them, and soon the giant pugilist was a ruined man. Leaving St. Louis for parts unknown, this once pet of the fancy is next heard of while carrying sacks on the levee at New Orleans, at the liberal compensation of thirty cents an hour. A few days ago he was seen in this city by the well-known sporting man and ex-pugilist, Tom Kelly, looking rusty, very rusty.\n\nTom Allen is now in England, and parties well informed vow that Tom intends returning to St. Louis ere long with the intention of ending his days in the \"Future Great.\" Today only two sporting houses of this class and of any note flourish in St. Louis. The best known is that kept by Tom Kelly, an old-time pugilist and sporting man, well known in St. Louis as one of the \"old timers\" and \"a good man.\"\n\nTom was called on by a POST reporter for the purpose of finding out where the old-time pugilists had gone to locate, but the veteran was in an uncommunicative mood, and all the information that could be gained from him was that the old-timers \"had gone to grass.\" \"McCoole was among them,\" replied the reporter, \"and by the way, Mr. Kelly, you saw him go there, I believe?\" \"I think I did,\" grunted Tom, and the writer, seeing that the gentleman was 'out of sorts,' doffed his hat and left the premises in disgust, wending his way to the saloon known as Jim and Doc's, a well-known resort of the fancy, located on Seventh Street, a few doors south of the fire engine-house. The genial proprietor of this house once officiated as bartender for Allen and is well posted on ring matters. Over his bar, pictures of Tom Allen, Arthur Chambers, and Billy Edwards, the noted lightweights, adorn the walls, dressed in fighting toggery. Pictures of other old-time fighters of lesser note also add to the sporting and pugilistic tendency of the establishment. In the rear, a piano is thrown open and a general free and easy appearance pervades the whole quarters. At night the boys meet here and sing songs and drink beer, intermingled with stories of the olden times, when ring fights were the order of the day and pugs were counted as solid men. Those were the days as \"fun was fun and fight was fight,\" remarked an old timer. \"Where have all the old timers gone to? Well, that would be hard to tell; let's see—\n\nDick Hollywood, champion featherweight, has been in town for the last few days. Tom Allen is in England, Mike McCoole is nowhere in particular and everywhere in general; Butt Riley is reported living in New York; Jack Looney is the proprietor of an establishment in St. Louis; John Dwyer is in Brooklyn; Dooney Harris, Mike Coburn, Joe Goss, Johnny Reilly, Arthur Chambers, Billy Edwards, Pete Lawler, Johnny Moore, Billy Kelly, and a host of others, are quartered in Gotham. Sam Collyer and Goodwin are serving a term in the New Jersey State Penitentiary. They were sent there for being seconds in a fight which took place near Philadelphia, in which one of the principals met his death. The New York and Philadelphia sporting men are working hard to secure a pardon for the plucky little Sam, and his case will be presented before the Board of Pardons at Trenton, N. J., during the present session.\n\nIn the days when Allen and McCoole's establishments flourished here, each man had his clique, and when the first great match was made between these two rivals, the excitement among the partisans of both was intense. Each party vowed their man was the best and gamest one of the two, words were bandied back and forth, and barrels of wealth were put upon the final result. The excitement and betting were contagious, and soon good and true citizens who hitherto had looked upon the prize ring as beneath their notice caught the fever, and talked of nothing but \"fight,\" as well as backing their opinion with the filthy lucre. The ladies too had their favorite, and wagered gloves, fans, etc., as to who would come out first best in the fight. It was in May of the year 1869 when papers were duly drawn up and signed by Tom Allen and Mike McCoole, whereby these two giants were to enter the roped arena and engage in a fair stand-up fight according to the rules of the London prize ring. The stake was to be $1,000 a side, and the 15th day of June was named as the date.\n\nA reference to the rattling mill will prove of interest to St. Louisans, as well as to many others who remember the stirring incidents on the river in connection with the fight.\n\nMcCoole had for his seconds Jerry Donovan and Tom Kelly, while Butt Riley and Sher. Thurston waited upon his opponent. Jack Looney stood umpire for McCoole, Steve Halloran for Allen, and Val McKinney officiated as referee. The battleground selected was Foster's Island, which lies twenty-six miles below this city. At that time the friends of McCoole were far more numerous than those of Allen, and as their favorite entered the ring he was greeted with loud and prolonged cheers, while few voices were raised to greet Tom, it being evident that the sympathy of the crowd was largely on the other side of the house. After the men had disrobed, McCoole, with an air of bravado, walked over to Allen's corner, and, producing a roll of notes, offered to wager $1,900 on the result, to which Tom replied that he had no money; these words were hailed with renewed cheers for Mike and hisses for Allen.\n\nAllen, seeing how the crowd was against him, rose to his feet, and, raising his hand to obtain silence, said: \"Gentlemen, I have no money, or I would freely bet it. And I am very sorry that so much prejudice exists in regard to my nationality. I declared my intention to become a citizen of the United States two years ago, and, if you will give me time enough, I will prove myself as worthy a citizen as any of you. I came here today to fight this gentleman, and all I ask of you is to give me a fair show. I ask no favors. I have no money, but I am going to try to win some, and will do my best.\" This manly speech was applauded by a few, but had little effect on the vast majority, who were blinded by prejudice and admiration for their man. Seventeen rounds were fought, and at the end McCoole was terribly used up, but his friends, who were determined he should win at all hazards, flourished their revolvers and knives, and gave utterance to all kinds of dire threats with a view to intimidate Allen. And in the last round cries of \"foul,\" \"foul,\" \"he’s gouging,\" etc., were raised by the McCoole party, and the excited mass covered the fighting ground; clubs were wielded promiscuously, while the referee was besieged by enraged men, armed with murderous weapons."

    text: "The proposed prize fight between Tom Kelly and Mike McCoole, which was talked of a few weeks ago, and the negotiations for which all ended in wind, has set the old-timers to thinking and talking over old fights. It was only the other night that a bevy of admirers of the manly art congregated at Tom Kelly's place on Sixth Street and pounded each other with the gloves. After the fun was at an end, the boys met at the festive board and argued the point as to which was the best fight ever took place in this immediate vicinity. Each and every man expressed a difference of opinion on this subject. Some would suggest that Allen and McCoole's fights were, in the main, the most interesting. Others, probably older in experience than the rest, said these fights could not hold a candle to the turn-up between Shanghai Connors and Pete Gallagher.\n\nFriends of Jack Looney who happened to be present turned up their respective noses at the mention of these mills and vowed that they were not to be compared in any manner, shape, or form to the meetings between Looney and Jim Coburn. On hearing these pugs argue the point, a reporter, who happened to be present, determined to look up the old-time fights and see which millerite had done the most milling, which had won the most fights, and which had made the best record. After a deep research into the old pugilistic records, the following table, containing a mention of each and every fight that has ever taken place in St. Louis and vicinity, has been secured and is now presented to the many admirers of the manly art, leaving them to judge as to which man has done the best work and to whom should be awarded the title of \"champion.\"\n\nThe first prize fight in this vicinity of which there is any record took place on May 18, 1847, between Wm. Edwards and James Johnson for $10 aside. The battle was fought at the coal mines and from all accounts was a savage affair, the rules of the ring being totally ignored. This fight resulted in the death of Edwards.\n\nOn June 16, 1856, Dan Williams got away with Pat Carey at Bloody Island for a $50 stake.\n\nThe 25th day of May, 1857, was a day with notable events in the pugilistic almanac. Frank McIntyre and Jim Brown pounded each other at Eagle Island, six miles above Alton, for $200 a side. They fought twenty-four rounds in twenty-six minutes, Brown being declared the winner by Aleck McClean, who acted as referee.\n\nIn the same ring, Enoch Davis and Jim Lafferty contended for the same amount of money. This fight passed through 102 rounds, Lafferty receiving a terrible beating but winning the fight by Davis hitting him foul.\n\nThis was followed on the 20th of October by a fight between Tom Jennings and Bill Blake, the latter well known as \"Dublin Tricks,\" McCoole's late trainer. The stakes were $100 aside, and the battle took place at Gabaret Island. In the ninth round, Tricks caught his adversary by the right leg and threw him. A cry of foul was raised, and the matter was referred to the referee, who ordered them to fight on. Time being called, Tricks refused to toe the scratch, and Jennings was declared the victor. This was the first prize-fight ever reported for a St. Louis paper.\n\nAt the first of September, 1857, several fights occurred near the Fair Grounds. Mobile Jack and a farmer started the ball rolling and after ten rounds brought Jack out the winner.\n\nCon. Keegan and Jack Looney fought twenty-three rounds on the same day. At the end of the twenty-third round, Con. cried \"Enough\" and Jack was declared the winner.\n\nA day or two after, Mickey Dee and a farmer named Adair had fourteen rounds, by which time the countryman cried \"Enough.\"\n\nThe 3rd of September, Pat Flynn and Bill Flannigan met on Bloody Island. After twenty-eight rounds, Flannigan giving a foul blow, Flynn was hailed the victor and given the $25.\n\nOn September the 14th, Jack Cope and Charley Holmes fought for $100 a side in the northern part of the city. Cope lost after a gallant struggle for victory.\n\nOn October 30, Jim Lafferty died at New Orleans.\n\nMarch 22, 1858, John Ahern and Henry Fitzgerald fought for $25 a side on Bloody Island. They had a slashing fight of twenty-two rounds, lasting twenty-five minutes. The ground being heavy, Fitz. fell down and the fight was claimed for Ahern. The referee was remarkably quick on the trigger, for he immediately agreed. The stake-holder, Dan Ryan, although of a contrary opinion, had no chance, and thus the game was blocked for the day.\n\nApril 12th, same year, Pat Carroll and Jim Brown fought for $100 a side six miles from the Court-house. Carroll won after twenty-eight remarkably good rounds had been fought in thirty minutes.\n\nOn May 19, Charley Holmes and Jack Cope again met, this time for $200 a side, near Alton. Holmes won by a foul, after a rattling contest of sixty-two rounds, lasting eighty minutes.\n\nThe next day Shanghai Connors and Pete Gallagher met on Bloody Island and fought for a made-up purse. The men did their work squarely from first to last, until Pete was fairly beaten in eighty-two rounds and ninety-five minutes.\n\nOn August 4th, Jack Looney and Jim Coburn, brother of Joe, fought an off-hand match, Jack betting $50 to Jim's $30. After forty-seven rounds in sixty-four minutes, with the thermometer marking 45° in the shade, Jack lost by dealing Jim a foul blow.\n\nAugust 8th, Joseph Stephenson, alias Welsh Joe, and John Reese milled at the Gravois Coal Diggings, for $50 a side and the local championship. Joe was the biggest man and got away with Reese, after twelve rounds had been fought, in twenty minutes.\n\nJack Looney and Jim Coburn had a second go for a purse of $50, near the Gravois road, on November 27th. After seventy rounds had been fought in seventy-five minutes, darkness coming on, Val. McKinney ordered a postponement until noon of the 29th. Coburn would not fight again, and the stakes were handed to Jack.\n\nThe 1st of May, Dick Keating got away with Mike Trainor in twenty-five rounds. This fight took place two miles below this city. A week later, Carroll and Jim Burns had a glove contest at Franklin Hall. Ninety minutes were wasted in pretending to fight, when the referee declared it a draw.\n\nOn March 14th, Jack Looney got away with Joe Cole in seventeen rounds, lasting forty-three minutes. Cole was five inches taller and weighed twenty-five pounds more than his conqueror.\n\nJune 21, Jim Phelan and Bill Macken fought for a small purse on Bloody Island. In the twenty-sixth round, Phelan broke one of his arms, but he fought with one arm until the end of the seventy-sixth round, when he won by Macken falling on him in a foul manner. The fight lasted eighty-three minutes.\n\nShanghai Connors and Jim Burns had their second picnic on August 8 at Eagle Island. In the 13th round, Burns hit Connors on the left as he was going down. The claim of foul was made, when the fight broke up in a general row.\n\nThe next battle in this vicinity took place on January 30, 1860, when John Hartnett and Keegan of New York had an off-hand fight, which resulted in Keegan's favor in five rounds, lasting twelve minutes.\n\nFourth of March, young Dutch Sam Hynes fought young Bennet for $25. After thirty-seven rounds in eighty minutes, Young Dutchy was declared the winner.\n\nAugust 3, Denny Harrigan, alias Dreadnaught, got beaten by Charley Fahey, after a fight of ninety-eight rounds, lasting 112 minutes. During the last four rounds, Denny fought with one arm.\n\nJuly 10, 1861, Tim Menahan knocked all the fight out of Mart Flaherty for $35 a side, in six rounds lasting...",
    summary: "Key figures Tom Allen, Mike McCoole, and Jem Mace highlight 19th-century St. Louis's prizefighting legacy, underscoring the era's vibrant, controversial pugilistic history."

    text: "Paddy Ryan, of Troy, New York, aged 29; weight 220; fighting weight 190 pounds; height 6 feet 1 1/2 inches; born at Thurles, Tipperary, Ireland, March 5th, 1853. Beat Joe Goss at Collier’s Station, West Virginia, June 21st, 1880, in one hour and twenty-four minutes; stakes $4,000 and the championship. Beaten by John L. Sullivan at Mississippi City, Miss, February 7th, 1882, in nine rounds and twenty-six minutes; stakes $5,000 and the championship.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan, of Boston, Mass., champion of the United States: aged 23; fighting weight 152 pounds; height 5 feet 10 inches. Beat Paddy Ryan at Mississippi City, Miss., February 7th, 1882, for $5,000 and the championship; nine rounds in twenty-six minutes.\n\nThe public is a very sensitive body, and whatever may be urged against any crooked transactions and want of fair play in sporting matters, it is generally known when events are to be conducted on a square basis. It is not easily fooled, and only a very short period of double dealing and bad faith is necessary to break up patronage bestowed on sport of any kind. That the fight at New Orleans yesterday was conducted on honest principles there is no reason to doubt, and however repulsive the spectacle may be, of two men beating each other out of shape, there can be no doubt but that the general interest taken in the affair has been of more than passing importance.\n\nYesterday Mr. Sullivan, of Boston, knocked Mr. Ryan, of Troy, into a state of insensibility in twenty-six minutes, after one of the gamest contests on record; thus carrying out the predictions of the POST-DISPATCH sporting editor, that the battle would be short and decisive. A retrospect is exceedingly timely, and there are some very interesting reminiscences to be recalled regarding pugilism in America. Perhaps ring fighting had no incentive in the country until the National American movement sprang up and then the native element was in the field for aggressive movement on every point. Catholic churches were riddled, engines and hose carts run by Americans, such as the Vigilance and Shiffler in Philadelphia attacked the Hibernia and Moyamensing companies, mounted by firemen of Celtic origin. The streets of Baltimore ran with blood, the Dead Rabbits and Bowery Boys fought for days and nights in New York streets; Macready, the English actor, was driven from the boards of the Astor Place Opera House, New York, and the militia had to be called out to suppress one of the bloodiest riots on record. Bill Poole and his confreres were held up as models for emulation for our youth, and when the former was shot by Lewis Baker—living seven days with a ball in his breast—the Government took enough interest in the matter to send a man-of-war after the aggressor and capture him in the Antipodes. Those were indeed stirring times: days of a riotous family strife, which had no place in history, but in which no man had safe place outside of his own doors.\n\nIn these mild, poetical and cheerful days such men as Frank Ambrose—known to history as Yankee Sullivan—and Tom Hyer came to the front as national antagonists. Their friends made a match and on February 7, 1849, they fought for the largest stake ever put up, $10,000. The battle was at Rock Point, Maryland, and Hyer, who represented the American faction, was the winner after a vicious battle. About this period Chris Lilly, Hammer Lane, Orville Gardner, Lar Bieral and scores of others were noted for their exploits in the ring and battles were numerous and hard fought.\n\nA new era was that in which Morrissey, who had long ranked as a good fighter in any shape, rough and tumble or according to the ring rules, and John C. Heenan figured. Heenan was known as the Benicia Boy, and despite his Hibernian origin ranked as the representative of the American element. His nickname was derived from the place of his birth, Benicia, Cal., where he worked as a blacksmith and laid the foundation for one of the grandest physiques ever given to mortal man. A match was made between them, the stakes being $5,000. The battle took place at Long Point, Canada, on October 20, 1858, and the excitement at the time was most intense and pulsated through the nation. Heenan was trained too fine, and the reduction was such that a terrible boil showed on his neck. He made no complaint but fought with the nerve and strength that only a natural gladiator could have exhibited under the circumstances. He punished Morrissey terribly, but the hard head of the Hon. John received the blows as though it was made of rock. The fight was a short one, and although Heenan was whipped he showed such stuff that it was virtually regarded as a victory for him. During their famous match Heenan had the good services of Aaron Jones, an ex-English champion. Morrissey retired after this, but in the subsequent battle between Heenan and Sayers, fought at Farnborough, England, in 1860, he was notable from the fact that he sided with the Englishman against his old antagonist, which created a very bitter feeling against him, and the impression of which he was many years eradicating in New York. The Farnborough fizzle, in which Heenan whipped Sayers almost to a standstill—at which point a mob broke in and robbed the American of his laurels, is a matter of pugilistic record. Heenan afterwards fought Tom King, the English champion afterwards, but was defeated by him. Heenan was out of condition and although he never squealed it was openly asserted that he was given painted food the morning of the fight. About this period Edmund Price and Australian Kelly fought, the former beating the latter and breaking a couple of his ribs. Price is now a rather prominent legal practitioner in Washington courts. One of the greatest ovations ever offered to mortal man was given to Heenan in July, 1860, after his return from England after his Sayers fight. This was at Jones Woods, New York, and upon a raised stage he sparred with Prof. Ouitignon in presence of a multitude, so large that only a small portion of it could possibly see the exhibition. From morn almost to dewy eve, the street cars struggled along under the burden of humanity which crowded not only the interiors and platforms, but the very roofs, and scores clung to the windows from the outside. Henry Bergh’s star had not then arisen.\n\nHeenan died about eleven years ago, and, it must be said, much regretted by those who knew him. He had many manly qualities, and was in private a quiet and inoffensive man. At the time of his death he was a successful gambler in New York, he and his old adversary, Morrissey, having fallen into the same line of business. Morrissey’s political life was well known, and he was noted for his fidelity to his friends, to his faith in his own word and for owning the most brilliant gambling house ever instituted in America. He was a great poker player, and there is a story extant of his having sat down to a little game with Ben Wood, proprietor of the New York Daily News, which lasted three days and nights, and in which a cool $100,000 changed hands. Long previous to this Joe Coburn’s name was as familiar as a household word in New York and as a bar room fighter, and as a very expert and scientific sparrer he gained some renown all over the country. Coburn came of a fighting family, his brother Mickey being a splendid lightweight fighter.",

    text: "Tom Allen surprised his old friends by dropping in upon them last evening. It is six years ago since he left St. Louis, and he returns looking as hale and hearty as the day he departed. He is as straight as ever, and there is the same bright look in his eyes. Asked as to how he felt, he replied that he was as well as ever in his life, barring a sore throat, the result of a slight cold. The story which went the rounds to the effect that Rooke had knocked him out easily was mentioned, and in response to the query as to how that happened, he laughed and said: “Why man, there was no knocking out there. It was a friendly set-to with soft gloves, and before we went at it, it was understood we should go light. The people howled at Rooke and then at me, but bless you we weren't going to give them a two dollar show for fifty and seventy-five cents. When we were winding up my foot went through a plank of the stage and I fell heavily. Then the crowd yelled and the reporters sent out word that I was knocked out, but bless you there was no knocking.”\n\n“You think, then, you could hold your own with Rooke?”\n\n“Why, bless you, easily,” said Mr. Allen.\n\n“Out here they say Cleary, of Philadelphia, is the best man in the country, barring Sullivan.”\n\n“Don’t you believe it. I set to with him just after the meeting with Rooke, and he isn’t nearly as clever as George.”\n\n“What do you think of Sullivan?”\n\n“He's a stout young fellow, but bless you, he won't fight. He'd be a fool if he did, for he can make twice the money at knocking out. I'd meet Sullivan, but he won't meet me. It wouldn't pay him to do so.”\n\nTom was asked what he intended doing out here, but was reticent on this point. It appears, however, that he came here in response to an invitation sent him by a gentleman who was at his back in nearly all the old fights. This gentleman intended setting Tom up in business here. As soon as the old fellow is located he will challenge any man in the world to fight for any sum and the championship. He will not expect an answer from Sullivan, but hopes to hear from Rooke, Cleary, Mace or the latter's protege. The battleground to be chosen in the event of such a fight taking place will be in the Indian Nation, on the line of the M., K. & T. road, a day's ride from St. Louis. This point will be selected for the purpose of avoiding police interference and to do away with the prospects of a “barney.” The managers of the match, if it is made, will expect a larger attendance than if the fight was to take place on sacred soil, and while the Eastern cities may not be well represented at the picnic, the big western towns will be expected to furnish large delegations. That Allen means fight there is no doubt. The poor record made by him with the gloves since his return, he says, is the result of his own indifference, for, like all old men at the business, he prefers work with the bare fists to either hard or soft gloves.\n\nIn Chicago Allen received a pretty rough deal. He says that up there ‘the Parson’ and a few others wanted him to indulge in a hippodrome with Elliot, but he refused to be a party to any such affair. Then ‘the Parson’ and a lot of others spread the report that he was on a big spree, had become a total wreck and all that sort of thing.\n\n“Who spread the report that you were played out and not even a match for Rooke?” the reporter asked.\n\n“Joe Elliott, the old fellow who writes for the New York Herald, started that story,” said Tom. “He’s had it in for me for something or other.”"

    text: "\"He's another bloomin' cove lookin' for American dollars,\" said an old pugilist when a reporter asked him if Mitchell, the newly arrived champion of England, intended to meet Sullivan in the ring. \"None of these chaps as has come out lately is lookin' for a fight,\" he continued, \"when they won't fight when they has ter. They run away and wait for their man and down him with a pop—a pistol is what I mean—a lot of blokes who has as much fight in 'em as the feller as was downed. They club together and get him a rosewood box, and a hearse with four white hosses, and wear mourning badges, and have a bloomin' big wake and bury him with honor. Why, it makes me tired to think on it. This thing is what is called by the tony chaps a new hero in pugilism; well, I guess so too, but it ain't no good. All these knocking out rackets is fakes.\n\nOh, you want to know something about these knockin'-out matches, eh? Well, I'll tell you, but it's hardly fair, though I guess it's time the public quit givin' up a dollar to see a couple of fellers puttin' up their dukes for no more than twelve minutes. This thing was started last year when Tug Wilson came over here to have a go with Sullivan. Well, that was on the night of July 17, I think, an awful hot 'un, too, and the Garden was packed. The papers said as how there was more'n 12,000 people in the place and some of 'em had paid as much as $5 to get inside and swelter while Sullivan and 'Tug' hammered each other. Now, the fact is Tug was knocked out, for he laid on the floor once for nearly half a minute before the fight was given him in the end. But he was there at the end of four rounds and the pair divided some £20,000. Well, yer see that is a big sum for a fighter, and Billy Madden is a smart man, and it was him as did all the fine work of gittin' the crowd there. Oh, he's a smart 'un, is Billy. Well, yer see when Sullivan seen that he lost the fight he got mad at Billy Madden because Billy had paid more attention to the sale of tickets than to him, and then there was a kick, and the big dufter split from his camp, you know, like the opera folks do. Then Billy probably told him—yer mind as how I says 'probably'—as how he would go to England and get a bloke as would knock him out, and then parted as strangers—do you see?\n\nWell, while Madden was in England another man got it into his nut as how there was big money in the business, and he imported Tom Allen, who once was pretty good, but who, lately, is good for nothing. He was heralded by the announcement that he would meet Sullivan in the twenty-four-foot squared circle for £2,500 aside, and a great many other things as weren't all as true as gospel. Well, the Allen fake didn’t pan out, as when his backer saw what a puffy old man he had grown to be he didn’t want any part of it. Why, it’s an actual fact that one night at the Garden, at his benefit, he wound up with George Rooke, who knocked him down twice and then they had on gloves as big as pillows. Well, Tom went west. Then the same feller what sent out Tom sent to the bush of Australia for a half-breed Maori, or whatever he is, and before seein’ him, said he would be backed for £2,500 against Sullivan. Well, Slade, who is a big enough feller, arrived here with Jem Mace, and the newspapers made a big card of them, and told all their movements as though they were looking for a fight, while, as the people who are on the inside knew, two oxen and a log-chain wouldn't drag the Maori to Sullivan or Sullivan to the Maori.\n\nWell, then the next feller to arrive is this Mitchell, who, after winning the championship of England, because he had pillowcases on his hands and nobody worth speaking of to lick, is brought across the herrin’ pond to make money. The first thing now is for Mitchell to issue a challenge, sayin’ as how he would like to meet Slade, Sullivan, Jem Mace, Joe Goss or Tom Allen for $5,000 to £10,000 a side. Of course they all know what that means and fail to reply. Next thing is to get up a mammoth entertainment in the Garden, where Mitchell will offer any man in the world $500 to wind up with him in four rounds.\"\n\nThe reporter thought he saw the point and he bade the pugilist good-by.",
    summary: "The article exposes 19th-century boxing frauds, involving figures like Tom Allen and Tug Wilson, where orchestrated matches prioritized promotion and ticket sales over genuine competition."

    text: "“The Humane Society agents will not be on hand to-morrow,” said a prominent sport to a Post-Dispatch reporter, who dropped into Tom Allen’s saloon Saturday night, “and a good day’s sport will be had at the main, which takes place to-morrow morning without fail.” The cockfighters of St. Louis and vicinity have for the last two months made extensive preparations for a cocking main on a large scale which was to have taken place a week ago from yesterday near the Orphans’ Home out on the St. Charles rock road, but on account of the sickness of one of the most interested parties, the main was postponed for a week.\n\nSome of the parties who had cocks in training for two weeks previous objected to the postponement on the ground that longer confinement would injure their fighting conditions, so they agreed among themselves to get off a few of the contests last Sunday, and for that purpose repaired to a lane behind Bellefontaine Cemetery. A fair crowd assembled, but the affair became so thoroughly advertised that the Humane Society swooped down upon the sports just as the cock which Roger Woods had pitted for $15 against a bird owned and backed by Henry Tedford was about dying. The interruption was fortunate for Woods, as he hurried his bird into a sack and saved his stakes, his bird dying just as Holmes and five policemen appeared upon the scene and brought the sport for that day to an end.\n\n“You see,” continued the sport, “a certain class of cockfighters in this town can give a main whenever they feel like it. They can advertise it for two weeks till everyone knows it, but not one of their gatherings were ever interrupted by the vigilant officers of the Humane Society. Now, if some of the smaller fry go out to have a little sport, the mounted police hound them and the Humane Society officers follow, as was the case last Sunday, and if the least evidence is obtained, a vigorous prosecution follows.”\n\n“How did the police find out about last Sunday’s main?”\n\n“Some of the privileged parties who were not interested in the main gave them the tip, but they were not quite ‘fly’ enough to make a case. If the Humane Society allows those fellows to fight because they happen to have a little influence with the Mayor, I think they ought to be ‘fired’ and the whole thing shown up.”\n\nThe sport is much admired among his associates for his forensic abilities; and as he warmed up to his subject, it became painfully evident that the dereliction of duty on the part of the Humane Society agents and mounted police would be the subject of a masterly oratorical effort unless the catastrophe was speedily averted, and when the flow of eloquence was checked by an invitation to drink, the momentary advantage was followed up by an earnest request to seek some place where a social chat could be indulged in without attracting general attention. When the street was reached, the sport returned to the original subject. “The main,” he continued, “will take place out on the old camping grounds, on the St. Charles Rock road, and not less than 1,000 men will attend it.”\n\n“Who is getting up the fight?”\n\n“Al Jerome and a young man living in Butchertown named Buttermore were in a saloon the other night speaking about the good fights that took place at Joe Lucas’ pit last year till the Post-Dispatch raided it. Buttermore said he had the best cock of his weight in St. Louis, and Jerome proposed to find him one that could lick him for $50. Buttermore took him up, and Henry Tedford suggested that good cocks ought not to fight for less than $200, and the match was made for that amount.”\n\n“Will there be only one fight?”\n\n“Henry Tedford will have at least a dozen cocks of as good a strain as there is in St. Louis, and every one of them will be pitted unless his roll gives out, but as it is always pretty large, that is not likely to happen; then Bill Gardenbolt will take not less than six cocks, every one of which will be pitted for a round sum. George Grassmuck is going, and he never went to a fight without a well-filled wallet and plenty of birds to contest for it. Plenty others will bring cocks which they are anxious to fight, and if there are not fifty fights and $10,000 won or lost to-morrow, it will be because the fight was interrupted or the boys changed wonderfully since last year.”\n\n“Will you be there?”\n\n“Yes, and if you meet me at Tom Allen’s, I will take you out, if you want to run the risk of being hung.”\n\n“What time will the main commence?”\n\n“Early in the morning. Meet me about seven o’clock and we will be on time.”\n\nThe reporter was on hand at the time mentioned and had not long to wait before his guide arrived. The crowd was expected to meet in Butchertown before starting for the battlefield, to stake the final wagers on fights already agreed upon, and complete all preliminaries for the day’s amusement. Arriving at Butchertown, the rendezvous was easily found. At least a hundred men, on foot, in vehicles of all descriptions, and on horseback were assembled, nearly all of whom carried suspicious-looking sacks, which they handled very tenderly. About half-past eight, the crowd became impatient, and the question “What keeps Jerry?” was frequently asked, but not answered. When the patience of the crowd was nearly exhausted, someone cried out:\n\n“Here he comes!”\n\nAnd a glad smile overspread the countenances of nearly all as a diminutive individual with a last year’s straw hat and an alpaca coat drove up in a very rickety buggy behind a distressingly hungry-looking horse. This proved to be the cause of the delay. Al Jerome, or, as he is familiarly called, “Jerry.” Another disagreeable delay resulted over a dispute between “Jerry” and Henry Tedford about where the main should take place, “Jerry” contending that it would be unsafe to fight in the county, as the Humane Society knew the main was to take place, and, in all probability, would be on the grounds and make a wholesale raid. The question was finally settled by a vote of those present, it being decided to visit Venice, where the sport could be carried on in perfect safety.\n\nThe sacks were hastily stowed away in the vehicles, and the crowd started for the river in different directions, to attract no attention. It just lacked ten minutes to noon when a pit was formed in the hollow below the “Mayor’s Saloon,” in Venice. The pit was formed by placing six logs in an upright position and encircling them with a rope. The crowd from St. Louis had increased to nearly six hundred, and the spectators furnished by Venice brought the assemblage in the neighborhood of 1,000. Delegations were in attendance from Dogtown, Butchertown, Buttermilk Prairie, Cote Brilliante, Compton Hill, Kerry Patch, East St. Louis, Carondelet, and other cock-fighting localities. Among those whom the reporter noticed were Ward Reilly, Henry Tedford, Al Jerome, Bill Gardenbolt, Buck Reilly, Pat Dillon, Mike McGuire, Jule Monday, Charley Brown, Jerry Slattery, Harry Higgins, Joe Murray, J. B. Smith, Wm. J. Aetna, George Grassmuck, M. McHugh, Thomas Hogan, John Butler, Thomas Lee, John Galvin, Robert Lewis, James Green, Julius Thomas, Dick Shea, Thomas Sullivan, James Sweeney, Pete McCormick, Thomas Lawler, Mike Gannon, Bill Nobles, Matt Brown, Bill Risenleiter, and Frank Sible.\n\nThe first fight was the most interesting."

Tom was clad in fine raiment, and wore the placid, easy expression which always marked his face as he stepped into a sixteen-foot ring. A swarm of witnesses were sworn in the case. Mr. Cornelius McBride acted as attorney for Mr. Allen, and examined Officer Hamilton, the first witness, after the prosecuting attorney had got through with him. Officer Hamilton said that Tom Allen’s saloon was on his beat and that disturbances often occurred there. He told in a charming manner of how men were “tumped” at Tom's, and of the high-toned conversations that preceded these performances, giving with much gusto, the sacred couplings to statements concerning the birth and antecedents of the defendant and his assailants. He said he could hear swearing across the street and the singing in the saloon could be heard two blocks away. Officer Welch testified to about the same thing, saying that the way the waiters called “two beers” and “six beers” was fierce and barbaric, and calculated to arouse the slumbering passions of peaceably disposed people. Mr. Daly, the proprietor of the Metropolitan Hotel on Seventh street, between Chestnut and Market streets, said that there were persons in Allen’s saloon singing every night, and that at the end of every song somebody would strike the table with a hammer, and then a general hurrah went up. Fights occurred there frequently. At one time he saw eight or nine men taken out in the yard and placed under the hydrant to have the blood washed from them. He had heard Mr. Allen use language of the vilest kind. The noise was such that people would not remain in the rooms fronting on Allen’s property, and some alleged that they would not occupy those rooms for fear of being shot. Other witnesses were examined, and they testified that the singing was heard frequently. But they had only known one disturbance to occur there. Mr. McBride made an oratorical effort in which he characterized Mr. Daly as a chronic prosecutor with a passion for suing people. Judge Cady said that it had not been proved clearly that the house was a disorderly place, and that as for the singing it should be judged tolerantly. He discharged the Hon. Tom."

He says he has already paid them $250 each, and is disposed, if they give him time, to make the whole debt good. Farrell, however, got impatient, and, coming over here, made a money demand which Tom thought unfair, hence he declined to submit. Farrell then adopted an aggressive plan, sent for a requisition, and procured the arrest. The pugilist gave bond in the sum of $2,000, with Fred Walters and Jos. Scinnalder as sureties, and he declares his purpose of turning the tables on Mr. Farrell and prosecuting him for an attempt to extort.",

    text: "This morning the hearing of the evidence touching the requisition for Tom Allen, the prizefighter, was heard in the Court of Criminal Correction. In 1876 Allen, who was then in his prime, fought Joe Goss on the Kentucky side of the river near Covington. The whole party was arrested at the time, and later the spectators were tried in the Covington courts. Goss and Allen went to New York. Shortly before the day set for trial, Goss returned to Kentucky, stood trial, and was fined. Allen took a steamer about that time and went to England, where he took up his residence. Upon returning to America, he came to St. Louis, and since then the trouble over the old affair began. Mr. Farrell was among the prizefighter's bondsmen, and at his instance, Allen was arrested several days ago to await the arrival today of a requisition from Kentucky. When the matter was called up for argument, counsel Rochester Ford stated that, owing to the late and delayed mails, the necessary papers had not yet arrived, although he had telegraphic information that the requisition had been issued at Frankfort. This the defense denied, stating that the telegram spoken of was sent by Mr. Farrelly’s brother and not by any of the state officials. It was further contended that the Kentucky requisition would not be honored in this state as the offense charged was only a misdemeanor. The details of the case were then gone into. Allen said that he had long since begun to settle the forfeited bond business and secure his bondsmen against loss on his account. He then made a statement of his financial transactions with Farrell. The latter's receipt for $200 was produced by the defendant's attorney, and the statement was openly made that the legal proceedings instituted and occupying the time and attention of the court were simply an attempt to collect a debt by Mr. Farrell. An anonymous letter to Allen stating that he might avoid all trouble by making a financial settlement at once was shown, and the defendant stated that such was the foundation of the case.\n\nAfter hearing the propositions for both state and defense, the Prosecuting Attorney said he would not press the matter. Judge Noonan said that he acquitted Mr. Ford of any blame for presenting such a matter to the court, as he did not think he was fully acquainted with the facts of the case. The issue of a warrant against Allen as a fugitive from justice was a matter in the hands of the Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, but the applicant would be compelled to make a better showing than the one made in court to secure a warrant. Taking all the testimony into consideration, Judge Noonan said he thought the case would never have been instituted if the money had been paid to the complainant, and Allen was accordingly released from custody.\n\nAs soon as the Allen matter was disposed of, John D. Birmingham was called and an attorney stepped forward to represent the state. A short consultation was held, and the announcement made that the charge of assault to kill would be dismissed for want of prosecution as Singleton I. Cave, the man who swore out the warrant, failed to put in an appearance and refused to testify. This wiped from the docket a case that promised to lay bare a queer state of affairs in a North St. Louis household. Cave was an unwelcome visitor at Birmingham's house during his absence, and if the story of his friend is to be believed, the claim he had was his relations with Mrs. Birmingham before her marriage. The mental suffering of the young husband ended by the discovery of Cave in the yard one night, and an attempt to put an end to the disturber's life.\n\nAfter several continuances, the case of Allen Moore, who was held for the murder of David Hankin, at Cote Brilliante, was dismissed today in Judge Noonan’s court. Before the Coroner, a case was made out, but under the cross-examination by Messrs. Jones and McBride, for Moore, the facts were laid bare and found to be insufficient to substantiate a charge of murder in the first degree, and the defendant was discharged. This leaves the murder of Preacher Hankin, at his supper table, a mystery that will probably never be solved. It will be remembered that Hankin, who was a laborer and a colored preacher, was seated at his supper, in his house near the Fair Grounds, some months ago, when a shot was fired through the window, which killed him almost instantly. A man was seen running away, and further up the road a woman's dress was found, which the murderer had evidently used as a disguise, and which he dropped in his flight.\n\nThe detectives and coroner thought they traced this dress into the possession of Allen Moore, another negro, who has been since an inmate of the jail, charged with the murder. Judge Noonan's decision, however, set him free this morning."

Crittenden to-day ordered a jail pardon to be issued to Clarence Thompson, confined in the Jackson County Jail, under sentence of a Justice of the Peace for thirty days for petit larceny.\n\nJudge Chester H. Krum appeared before Gov. Crittenden this morning and asked the Governor to refuse to surrender Tom Allen, the pugilist, upon the requisition of Gov. Knott of Kentucky. He held that the Governor had such a right, and that it was his duty to exercise his discretion in the premises. He stated that Allen was indicted in Kentucky in 1876 for prize fighting. The crime was not a felony, but only a misdemeanor. It had been eight years ago. The authorities of Kentucky had had ample opportunity to arrest Allen and bring him to trial if they had so desired. He held that the present effort was not in good faith, but that the object was to enforce the collection of a debt due from Allen to Farrell, the bearer of the requisition, in support of which he read a letter from Prosecuting Attorney James R. Claiborne of St. Louis, and addressed to Gov. Crittenden. He also read the affidavit of Tom Allen and other parties and a letter from Farrell to Allen, all sustaining that view of the case. After his close, Rochester Ford appeared in behalf of Farrell. He claimed that due diligence had been made to arrest Allen and bring him to trial; that the proceedings were in good faith. When he concluded, the Governor complimented his effort, but said, “I shall not act hastily in this matter. I am not prepared now to honor the requisition. I shall consider it well before taking final action. Meanwhile Mr. Farrell may go back, and if I should decide to turn Allen over I will send him to Kentucky.” From the Governor's remarks and the manner of his expression, it would appear that Allen will not be turned over or sent back to Kentucky.",

    text: "The police of Central District have another mysterious shooting case on hand. At 1 o'clock this morning Frank Rush was shot in front of Tom Allen's saloon at 621 Market Street by an unknown man, who made his escape after a very determined attempt to murder his man. The statements of the various parties failed to agree in important details, which are not matters of hurried impression but questions of fact concerning which there is no good reason for irreconcilable stories. Free and easy concerts are given at Allen's place. Each person in attendance is called upon to add to the entertainment, which is filled out by regulars when the time lags. Among those attaches of the place is Frank Rush, a coal miner, who lodges over the saloon. Recently, according to the proprietor's statement, Rush has been laboring about the city, spending his evenings at the saloon. Last night the crowd had dwindled down when a stranger, who is described as 5 feet 10 inches high, dark complexion, slim built, smooth face, wearing a long dirty grey overcoat, low shoes and about 25 years old, entered the place. The statements of the subsequent occurrence, which may possibly result in a murder, are as follows: Tom Allen, the proprietor, said: “I was playing cards in the concert-room when this fellow came in. He said he was here from Chicago on a spree and asked for a woman on Eighth Street. He was so drunk he couldn't light his cigar and Rush hit him a tip. He staggered out after falling against the partition and then he fell by the window. Christ Hoff, the bartender, told Rush to go out and see that the fellow didn’t tumble in through the window. It wasn't half a minute before we heard the shots as fast as a man could fire a gun. When we got outside the man was gone.\"\n\nRush's first statement was as follows: “I gave him a light and he staggered out against the door. I went out after him to brace him up. He fell against the window. I grabbed him by the shoulder and said: ‘Look out, old man, you'll break the window.’ He said: ‘Let go, d—m you,’ and pulled out a revolver and began shooting. I said: ‘Don’t shoot, I won't hurt you,’ and he said: ‘I guess you won't.’”\n\nThose who saw the man run away say he was not drunk but ran rapidly. At the saloon even all parties admit that possibly the man thought he was being robbed, a theory shared by the officers. Rush had one bullet extracted from his shoulder. The second is lodged in the chest. Two of the shots evidently missed the mark.\n\nFrank Rush, the wounded man, is now resting easy at his room over Allen's saloon. He denies that he knew the man, but on reconsidering the shooting, he said that it seemed less mysterious than it did last night, as he did not believe the man was really as drunk as he appeared to be. A crowd including Tom Allen, a young fellow named Spelker, and the bartender assembled around Rush's bed this morning and on an interchange of opinion they came to the conclusion that the shooting was premeditated. On entering the saloon last night the man said he was from Chicago and had come to this city to enjoy a spree. He was then apparently drunk, but a few minutes later sharpened a lead pencil, putting a fine point on without once breaking it. This was overlooked at the time, but, in the light of the new theory, it is taken as a strong evidence that the man was dissembling. He then walked back to the rear of the concert room, in which Allen and a young man were playing “seven up.” On his return he bought a cigar, which he put in his pocket, relighting a stump which he had in his mouth. He staggered against Rush and apparently only gained the door by chance. All are agreed that a very short time elapsed between the exit of Rush, who went to see that the window was not broken, and the shots. The manner in which he made his escape confirms the theory that he was not as drunk as he appeared to be.\n\nThe statement made by one of the habitues of the Champion's Rest was that the stranger resembled a man who was roughly handled and ejected from the place some time ago. The bartender was of the impression that he had seen the man before in this city. The story of the previous trouble could not be traced, but seems a very reasonable explanation of the shooting. Rush admits that he took hold of the man, and it is possible that the revengeful stranger also believed that he was being assaulted and robbed. Rush's wound in the chest is not as serious as was supposed. Dr. Nidelet, who made a casual examination at noon today, said he did not think any of the vitals had been struck by the ball.",
    summary: "Tom Allen's saloon hosted a mysterious shooting involving Frank Rush, a miner, by an unknown assailant. This chaotic 19th-century event mirrored the violent atmosphere of such venues."

    text: "Joe Goss had considerable history in England, but to readers on this side of the creek, his American experience is of chief interest. He had a world-wide reputation as a fighter when he came here, arriving at Boston, Mass., in company with Mace, April 15, 1876. One of the objects of Goss in coming to America was to make another match with Tom Allen, who had gained fame and made money during his sojourn in the States, and was generally regarded as the rightful possessor of the championship title. Joe issued a challenge to Tom to contend for the honors of the position and a stake of $2500 a side, and, as Allen was perfectly willing to again face him, he promptly accepted and a match was speedily made. They fought September 7, 1876, on Kentucky soil, the ring being first pitched in Kenton County, and subsequently, owing to magisterial interference, it was erected in Boone County. They fought twenty-one rounds in all, in forty-eight minutes, when a decision was given in Goss' favor on account of a foul. Allen was in much the better condition of the two, Joe being trained too fine and going somewhat stale; but he was as plucky as ever, and took his punishment like one of the good old stock. Indictments were found by the Grand Jury of Kenton County against the principals, seconds, and other prominent persons, but Joe was the only victim, Allen jumping his bail, $3,000, and crossing into Canada, whence he proceeded by steamer to England. Goss was arrested in New York City, March 7, 1877, upon a requisition from the Governor of Kentucky, charging him with violating the State law. He was taken to Burlington, Ky., tried, convicted, and, on March 18, was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and to pay a fine of $250. He was committed to jail, from which he was released July 27 upon paying a portion of the fine imposed, the payment of the remainder being guaranteed by friends. Shortly after his release, he came to New York, where he for some years resided. After Johnny Dwyer retired from the P. R., leaving the championship open, Paddy Ryan issued a challenge to fight anyone for the title, which was accepted by Goss, and a match was made for $1,000 a side and the championship. After one postponement and two alterations in the place of fighting, they met at Collier Station, W. Va., June 1, 1880, when Goss proved himself the more scientific man by far, but he had grown slow, and he was ultimately compelled to succumb to a younger man by many years, eighty-seven rounds being fought in 1h. 23m. This closed his career as a principal in ring events. It was at his benefit in Boston, previously to the fight, that he first met John L. Sullivan, and it was from the showing the latter made against Joe that his name first came to be talked about outside of Boston. Sullivan and Goss were always fast friends, the veteran's admiration for the young phenomenon being unbounded.

Sullivan and Dominick McCaffery, who were advertised to fight tonight, was issued by Judge Hill this morning and placed in the hands of an officer for execution. They were charged with conspiring to commit a breach of the peace.\n\nA Post-Dispatch reporter called on Tom Kelly this morning in order to get his opinion of the Sullivan-McCaffery fight should it take place.\n\n“What do you think of it?\"\n\n“Why Sullivan will knock him out in the four rounds. I don’t think McCaffery will stand a ghost of a show. They say he is a scientific man, but he's not scientific enough for Sullivan. All he wants is to get his share of the gate receipts. Sullivan will draw a big crowd, but as for fight, why it’s foolish.”\n\nIn reply to the question what he thought of the proposed fight, Tom Allen laughed openly.\n\n“Why that old newspaper wind-bag McCaffery couldn't lick anybody. Of course if they are going to stop the fight as soon as Sullivan sails in, they don’t call that a fight. But if they let Sullivan go in to win he'll knock him out in one round. Why, d— it, if McCaffery wants to fight why don’t he tackle Burke or Greenfield? Mitchell knocked him out in three rounds, and then, like the great big baby he is, he ran away from these other fellows and wanted to fight Sullivan. Pshaw, it makes me sick to hear a chump like him talk of fighting John L. Gate receipts are what he wants and that’s all. I'd like to bet either Burke or Greenfield can best McCaffery, and mark my words, if Sullivan fights him he'll lay him out. He's got no use for that kind of a man, and if he ever gets a show at him look out for a picnic.”\n\n“If the police interfere and do not allow the fight to take place do you think McCaffery would go out of the city and fight Sullivan?”\n\n“No, sir; he won't. He's too big a coward and besides, that would let him out of the gate money.”",

    text: "In the life of all athletes, whether of the ring, the cinder-path, the oar or other department of sport, there comes a time when the limit of exertion and endurance has been passed, and the necessity of earning a living in some new way becomes a matter of necessity. Looking at a pugilist, in those days when he really used to fight, as he came up smiling in the thirtieth round, after an hour or two of hard fighting, and ready for an indefinite continuance of the supplying and receiving of punishment, one would almost think that so lithe and powerful a piece of physical machinery could never wear out: but the taps of time, day after day, tell upon prizefighters as well as the less generously endowed individual, and an invincible tendency to embonpoint, a dullness of the vision and a stiffness of the joints are the warnings which nature supplies him to abandon a sphere of usefulness for which he is no longer fitted. Of course these warnings are generally disregarded. It is as difficult to persuade a pugilist that he has become \"stale\" as it is to convince a veteran prima donna that her voice is losing its charm, and it is not generally until he has been made a spectacle of by some coming champion that he resigns himself to fate and retires to spend his days as the presiding genius of a place of public entertainment. The public house, or, as it is generally abbreviated, the pub, is the inevitable final refuge of the English pug, and it is not surprising that in this country the exponents of the manly art should follow their example and become saloonkeepers. In St. Louis there are two such establishments run by men who in their younger days were admirable examples of the race who fought one another with bare knuckles and to the finish, and to whom the kid glove and abbreviated exhibitions of modern days are subjects of more or less openly expressed contempt. One of these is presided over by Tom Allen, a representative of the English school of pugilism, who came over here years ago, fought his way to pre-eminent Cis-Atlantic fame, and finally settled down in St. Louis as the proprietor of a “free and easy,” patterned after those in vogue in England. To this place the Post-Dispatch special artist paid a visit yesterday evening. Passing through the busy bar he found himself in a hall where at a dozen circular tables sat a gathering of the place's patrons, among whom, along the saw-dusted floor, passed the waiters, very actively engaged. At the eastern end of the hall was a platform containing a piano, and immediately below was a table at whose head sat a large man, of middle age, whose big, good-natured face beamed with jollity as he answered the questions which were fired at him by surrounding admirers. There were about a dozen in number, and they ranged from beardless youth to venerable grandsire. The large man evidently found it warm work, for he was in his short sleeves and his ponderous right hand manipulated a fan with energy. His voice was loud and deep, and his careless disregard of the letter H revealed the fact that he was an Englishman. Presently he called a halt in the conversation, rapped on the table with a gavel, and announced a song, thereby revealing the fact that he was the proprietor.\n\nDuring the singing, which was by no means as bad as might be expected, perfect silence prevailed throughout the room, but directly it was over, conversation broke loose, and the ex-pugilist was once more made the target of a severe examination. His most persistent questioner was a very old man, whose appearance was rendered quite distinguished by a somewhat bloody handkerchief tied round his head, giving the impression that he had recently made a plucky but unfortunate venture in the pugilistic line, on his own account. He had been drinking and had entered upon the garrulous stage of intoxication and was, consequently, a trifle tiresome. Unlike the rest of the company, who discussed different heroes of the past in turn, he was determined to convert the proprietor and the others to his belief that, present company excepted, there had never been a prize-fighter like Tom Paddock. At last the more modern Tom gave him a conversational right-hander which \"sent him to sleep\" for the rest of the evening.\n\n\"Shay, Tom, ole f'ler,\" he asked for the twentieth time, \"now, shay, wash ever a man could down Tom Paddock?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, and there's a man can down John Sullivan, or you or any of them.\"\n\n\"Where'sh the man, Tom? Whash his name?\" the old man asked eagerly.\n\n\"There he is in your tumbler, and his name's John Barleycorn,\" was the reply, which was greeted with such a roar of laughter that the venerable individual tossed off his whisky to conceal his confusion and lapsed into a condition of listening silence.\n\nThe strange feature of the gatherings at Tom Allen's is their remarkable decorum. Presided over by a pugilist and surrounded by admirers of the fistic art, their proceedings are marked by a quiet which would do credit to a much more respectable resort. There is a flavor of sentimentality in the musical part of the entertainment, too, which is not devoid of a strain of melancholy: at any rate, their effect upon the listener was of that nature.\n\nThe habitues of the place are almost entirely of the working class of all grades, from the plain dollar-a-day laboring man who well knows that from his ranks have sprung many a noble scrapper of the past, up to the well-to-do mechanic and clerk of the minor order.\n\nThe place presided over by Tom Kelly is of a different type from the one previously visited. It is more American in its features, the principal one of which is a bar, which, Saturday night was presided over by the veteran himself, a man of about 45 years of age, upon whose vigorous frame the hand of time has laid but light touch as yet, though still serious enough to prevent him from entering the ring again.",

    text: "The much talked of contest between Jack Burke, the champion of England, and Ed Kelly of local fame, took place last night at the Casino Theater in the presence of one of the largest audiences the house ever held. Every local sport, prominent and obscure, was on hand and the event was distinguished by the presence of one or two city officials. The regular programme of the evening was gone through, and at 9:45 the stage was prepared for the pugilists. After some discussion, Mr. Dick Roche was fixed upon as referee. Mr. Al. Spink was chosen timekeeper. Pat Killen and Oscar Floto seconded Burke, and Tom Kelly and Tom Allen acted as seconds for Kelly. The final upshot of the affair was the decision by Mr. Roche that Burke had failed to knock out Kelly in four rounds, such being the proposition, and consequently, that he must forfeit the $100 he had staked on his ability to do it. Burke will pay the money today.\n\nIt was past 10 o'clock when the Irish provost stepped upon the stage and shook hands before starting in to work on the first round. They were applauded enthusiastically. The men then went at each other, sparred for a few moments, and Burke, finding an opening, planted a terrible blow on Kelly's neck which landed him on his back. He was up again but was downed a second time by Burke's left, the round finishing with a fall-down on the part of Kelly. The second round saw the St. Louis boy hammered about generally, the English Champion downing him three times in rapid succession. In the third round Kelly came to the scratch still plucky, but a little frayed at the edges. In this round Burke brought the blood from Kelly's nose and mouth with some heavy right-handers, laying him at every blow. He was knocked down twice and fell once without being touched.\n\nBurke claimed a foul and the referee warned Kelly that if this occurred the second time he would declare for Burke. In the fourth round Kelly was still in the ring though ready to fall from the mere wind of Burke's fist. In this round Burke hugged him to prevent him falling. Kelly was badly battered and fell from the slightest blow from Burke and took whatever advantage he could of the ten seconds allowed him to remain on the ground when he fell. These tactics rattled Burke considerably and when time was up he stepped to the front and said:\n\n\"Gentlemen, how can I knock a man out when he is on the ground all the time? Our agreement was to fight with two-ounce gloves, while the fight has been with four-ounce gloves. I can’t knock a man out with pillows.\"\n\nAt this juncture Mr. Roche approached the footlights and declared the night a draw. Some hot words were had all around and the curtain dropped, while the crowd dispersed with expressions of disgust at the evening's work. After the curtain had fallen Mr. Roche’s attention was called to the fact that his decision was erroneous, as a draw could not be decided in the premises. Burke had either failed to knock out Kelly or he had not; therefore, there could have been no draw. On this explanation Mr. Roche withdrew his former decision and merely announced, privately, the fact that Burke had failed to knock out Kelly in four rounds.\n\n\"That whole business last night was ‘Tug’ Wilson and Sullivan over again,\" said Oscar Floto, Burke's manager, this morning, to a POST-DISPATCH reporter at the Laclede Hotel. \"I could stay with Burke four rounds myself like any did. The first time he went down and stayed his ten seconds out, I knew the whole thing was fixed and I said to myself that if Jack didn't get his right hand in then on Kelly's neck, the thing could go on all night. That's what we wanted, and if Jack ever got that right-hander of his in, Kelly would have been knocked cold. How could he do it though when Kelly kept running around as though he was in a walking match instead of a fist match? Burke's opinion of the thing was expressed in a telegram he sent to Davies last night, in which he merely said: ‘It was Tug Wilson and Sullivan. Pshaw; Kelly ought to be able to stand up nineteen rounds like he did last night without phasing him.’\"\n\nKelly's friends feel generally jubilant over what they claim a victory. Tom took his son home and fixed him up in good condition. Beyond a scratch on his arm, which he received in a fall against the flies, and a little blood from his nose, Ed is all right.\n\n\"There was no necessity for a decision at all,\" said Tom today. \"It wasn't a fight at all. The understanding was that Ed was to stand up four rounds, and he did it; that settled it.\"\n\nThe contest was according to Marquis of Queensberry rules. During the four rounds which were fought Kelly was knocked down nineteen distinct times and fell down twice. Calculating on the ten seconds given to remain down, and he stayed it out every time, this would give him 210 seconds rest on the floor, or a little over one full round. The whole was a funny affair. Young Kelly was backed up by his father and Tom Allen, who did everything to encourage him and push him to the front, and the yells of \"Kelly!\" \"Give it to him, Ed!\" and a score of such marks of approbation from the audience managed to hold Ed up considerably. After the contest was over, Burke claimed that the agreement was to fight with two-ounce gloves. The fact of the matter was, that there was a split on the gloves, Burke insisting on using two-ounce and Kelly on four and three-quarter-ounce gloves. A compromise was then effected on four-ounce weapons, it being clearly understood that soft and not hard gloves were to be used. Many in the audience held rather strong opinions as to the affair, one gentleman, well versed in ring rules, holding that the decision should have been rendered in Burke's favor because of the foul in Kelly falling without being touched, the Queensberry rule on this point being that a foul loses the fight. It was thought further, that Mr. Roche erred in \"warning\" Mr. Kelly as the simple fact that he had fouled gave the fight to his opponent.\n\nJack Burke has no particular regret that young Kelly stood with him the four rounds, beyond what little irritation he might naturally feel. The fact will not derogate, in the slightest, from his reputation as a pugilist as it was altogether a negative contest. Had Kelly stood up to the scratch and endeavored to have used his aggressive and defensive tactics at the same time, which really constitutes the art of pugilism, Burke would have paralyzed him as he did Cleary in Chicago. One good thing, at all events, will come out of it and that to Kelly's benefit. He learned a lesson last night which he will never forget and which taught him more than he ever knew before. At his next encounter he will have more confidence and pluck."

The style was catch-as-catch-can rules and the wrestlers took every advantage they could of their latitude to the very border of the brutal. In the first bout, the Frenchman was the under man in the majority of the locks and his marvelous skill in using head spins at the proper moment helped him out of many a hold. A dangerous half-Nelson that locked Pierre in the terrible clasp of the Greek's right arm was followed by a turnover on which there was claimed a fall. This, however, was disregarded by the referee. After several futile attempts to tamper with the legs of his antagonist, Greek George sprung a back twist suddenly and with one shoulder touching brought all his weight to bear, and by slow degrees forced the other to the floor. The referee decided one fall for Greek George. The second bout was livelier than the first, and after the usual locks and evasions, the Greek succeeded in downing his opponent the second time. George now desires to meet Joe Acton of Philadelphia for $250 a side.",

    text: "The death of Mike McCoole caused hardly a ripple of surprise in sporting circles, though there was a time when it would have been an event of considerable note. He had been so long in retirement from the ring and lived so humble and obscure a life that many thought him dead for years. The younger generation of fighters and sporting men only knew of him in a vague sort of way as a big, strong slugger who had once been a sort of somebody in the fistic ranks. I knew him well, and saw him fight Bill Blake, the Western \"Dublin Tricks,\" Joe Coburn, Aaron Jones, and Tom Allen. He was a slugger, pure and simple, and his knowledge of the manly art was but rudimentary. He was as game as a pebble, though he had a way of flinching when he was hit hard that would lead one to think otherwise. Dublin Tricks would have whipped him with ease but for the crowd present. It was largely composed of the deck hands and roustabouts, friends of McCoole, and they made no bones of their intent to kill Blake if he won. Small wonder that he lost, as he did, purposely.\n\nThat Mike was a brave and thoroughly courageous man those who knew him best were the quickest to attest. Uncle Dave Bidwell of New Orleans told me that the morning he was to fight Tom Jennings he had some difficulty with his backers, and they refused to get him a boat to carry him to the fighting ground, which was on the west side of the river. This was after Jennings and his party had left the city. Nothing daunted Mike set out solitary and alone, with his fighting togs tied in a handkerchief and slung over his shoulders and walked up the levee to a point opposite where the ring was. His calls attracted the attention of the crowd. Jennings’ boat went over and ferried him across the river. \"I haven't a friend with me,\" said he, \"but if anyone will second me I'm ready to fight.\" Two men volunteered to handle him. He went into the ring and he had no difficulty in whipping Jennings, who was a much overrated man. Jennings had talked freely about fighting Heenan, but when the Benicia Boy reached New Orleans he would not put up either to fight him or Ned Price, who was then in his retinue. There was talk of matching him against Charley Perkins of Rochester, but it came to naught.\n\nMike's fight with Joe Coburn showed how superior skill and pluck were, when backed with a fair degree of strength, to mere pluck and strength alone. From first to last McCoole never had the ghost of a chance against his wily opponent, who gave him a terrible whipping. After the fight some of the gang wanted to abuse the poor beaten man, but \"Red\" Leary took his part and would not permit them to touch him. Mike lay groaning and moaning with pain and refused to be dressed. \"Get up,\" said Australian Kelly, his second, trying to frighten him into activity; \"the police are coming.\" \"I don’t care,\" was Mike's piteous reply, \"I can neither sit, stand nor walk. Let me lie here and die.\" He didn’t die, but got well, and was afterwards so sure that he could whip his conqueror that he made a fresh match to fight him. This came to nothing, owing to Coburn having been amicably arrested by a United States Treasury detective.\n\nPrevious to this Mike had met and defeated old Aaron Jones. The great opponent of Tom Sayers was but a ghost of his former self when he met McCoole, and only once in the battle did he fight with anything like his old-time form. That was about the middle of the contest when he let go suddenly with his left and landed on McCoole’s right eyebrow, cutting it as though it was done with a razor and letting the eyelid drop down like Ben Butler's. The blood flowed so freely that Mike could hardly see out of the eye. Had Aaron put out the other shutter in the same manner the fight would have been his beyond a peradventure. He did not and McCoole beat him so terribly that he never perfectly recovered, as he often afterward said. The finishing blow was a fearful one. It was a right-hander on the forehead and it floored Jones like a shot. It did not knock him insensible, however, but he flopped around on the ground like a chicken with its neck wrung. That afternoon Jimmy Elliot, who had arrived in Cincinnati too late to see the battle, met McCoole in the then famous St. Lawrence saloon, and said to him: \"You call yourself the champion of America. Why, you haven't whipped me yet.\" \"No, and I'll not fight with you, either,\" answered Mike. \"I'll not fight with a thief.\"\n\nTom Allen made a chopping block of McCoole on two occasions. The first time the enemies of Allen broke into the ring and robbed him of the fight. The next time Mike was beaten so badly that Tom Kelly gave in for him at the end of twenty minutes. He had no business with men of Allen's grade. He had a fondness for the \"river\" that nothing could conquer, and he liked his boating associates above all others. In the zenith of his fistic career, the champion of America, when in Louisville, he invariably stopped in a low doggery on the levee in preference to going to a first-class hotel. His reason was that the proprietor of the place had been his friend in his humbler days and he added, \"I'll not go back on him now.\" He was unfortunate in his marriage. His wife was a girl of some education and intelligence and was the daughter of a rich contractor of your city. I will not attempt to write of his St. Louis life for you all know much more of it than I do. The last time I saw Mike was the night before the Sullivan and Ryan fight at Mississippi City. I found him in a saloon near the head of Canal street in New Orleans. I had a ticket for him and I wanted him to go and see the fight but he declined, saying: \"Damn the fighters, they are no good. If I had my way I'd have every one of them in the calaboose.

Then he went at him skillfully, and as soon as Sullivan began to get his wind again he dodged him again. When Sullivan's wind was gone the second time, then Mitchell knew his business and pounded the big man with a certain amount of care that he didn’t get too dangerously near and exposed himself to too much risk. If Sullivan could have got one good crack at Mitchell while fresh the fight would have stopped in the second round.”",

    text: "The fight continued with clever exchanges on the face and jaw, blow for blow. Flint, when time was called, had the better of the round. The fighting still went on all in Mac's corner, opening with a hard one from Flint’s left in Mac's stomach. Flint came at his opponent now with a series of terrible right and left blows on the chin and under it, which caused the blood to spurt in streams from McManus’ mouth. Mac's lower lip was cut in two. The round ended with McManus very sick, weak, and unfit.\n\nIn this round, the fight, which had all along been in Flint’s favor, now turned its favor toward McManus, who, although felled three times to the ground, inflicted terrible punishment on his man, leaving him as weak as water at the end. Much blood was let on both sides, but Flint seemed to have weakened terribly. Flint’s left eye was now entirely closed. The work was even on both sides in this round, but the men were growing weak. Flint seemed to be badly winded and nearly gone.\n\nNothing was done in this round except sparring for wind. Flint struck twice on Mac’s jaw and Mac returned the compliment. Flint played for the stomach and McManus got back heavily upon the body and face. Flint’s eye was now the size of a goose egg. Tom Allen sucked the blood out of the wound. Flint was the fresher of the two and pounded McManus all around the ring, beating him unmercifully with both hands and confining his blows mainly to the face. Blood came freely from McManus’ mouth, nose, and ears. He suddenly recovered, however, and by two sharply dealt blows, one on the left jaw with the right and one on the right side of the neck with the left, knocked his man prostrate on the ground. Flint lay there like a log and did not respond. The referee decided the fight in McManus' favor.\n\nThis last round was probably one of the most peculiar that was ever seen in a prize ring. Up to this time, the fight was anybody’s game, and in the first three-quarters of this round, Flint had everything his own way. It was pitiful to see him beat the bleeding face of his opponent, and the really marvelous gameness which he displayed. Flint was fighting with one eye. The other was swollen and bruised and cut and bleeding from the sharp incision made by his second’s lance. No less marvelous was McManus’ rally. He seemed to awake from his stupor with the quickness of a lightning flash and, wheeling around on his man, dealt him the two deadly blows that finished him. Flint turned around twice like a man who was shot and then fell on the flat of his back with his legs spread out two feet apart. Ten seconds passed, and then Tom Kelly rushed over to the corner of the ring where Flint lay and flourished his right hand over his body like a Roman gladiator, shouting at the same time.\n\nWhat he said was utterly lost and swallowed up in the unearthly tumult that took possession of the men around the ring, who, drunk with alcohol and frenzied by excitement, acted more like wild beasts than rational beings. It was fully 12 minutes before Flint recovered his consciousness and 13 before he could stand erect upon his feet. McManus had to be helped up the hill to the station by his brother, and Flint was led between Tom Allen and Dan Daly. It required both their efforts to carry him. He was laid on the floor of the baggage car and cried continually: \"Oh, my head! Oh! My head.\"\n\nGreat interest was manifested in the fight by the country people, of whom about twenty-five were present at the battle. Flint’s defeat is a terrible disappointment to his friends, who confidently expected him to win. The time of the fight was one hour and fifteen minutes.\n\nHugh McManus is about 23 years of age and was little known in St. Louis before he arrived here a short time ago. McManus’ only fight of note, and about which there is no doubt, is against Daly, whom he fought in a 40-round battle, and the fight was then given to McManus on a foul. McManus trained for his fight in St. Louis and made many friends among sporting men here.\n\nArtie Flint’s record as a fighter is as brief as that of McManus. He was a cab-driver, hung around Allen and Kelly's places, and took to fighting. His other fight of any importance was with Dan Daly at Turner Hall in April. The fight was a bitter and desperate one.",
    summary: "In a clandestine 19th-century prizefight, Hugh McManus defeated Artie Flint in 17 rounds. Tom Allen's presence underscores the era's brutal bare-knuckle boxing culture."

    text: "Both of the pugilistic factions around the corner of Market and Seventh streets did nothing to-day but discuss the merits of the Daly-Allen fight which took place on short notice yesterday morning about the hour of 2 o’clock. The fight was the culmination of a very bitter feeling which has existed between the factions for some time past, and the Allen party came out second best in the scrimmage. There are two radically different versions of the affair. The Daly party, however, tell the more connected story of the battle, which was a free and general fight between Dan Daly and Tom Allen on the one side, and Charley Daly, Dan’s brother, and \"Dutchy,\" or Frank Neal, and Steve Hearne, two local lightweights and friends of Allen on the other.\n\nAccording to Dan’s story, which is borne out by the eyewitnesses to the affair, the middleweight champion of Missouri was sitting peaceably at the front door of his place of business on Seventh street when he noticed three men turn the corner of Market and run north. They were followed by Allen, \"Dutchy,\" Hearne, and another man who carried a baseball bat. When Allen arrived at Daly’s door he stopped, and, according to Dan, at once began to pour forth a volume of language, the gist of which was to seriously reflect on the parentage of everybody in the immediate neighborhood, paying particular attention to the Daly brothers and those who followed their fortunes. At this Dan protested and tried to argue Allen out of his apparent belief that the fugitives who had just passed were friends of his. Whereat Allen became riled and struck at Charley who, meanwhile, had joined the group. The fighters then divided, Charley looking after \"Dutchy\" and Hearne and Dan confining his attention to the ex-heavyweight champion.\n\nBut if anyone fancies that these events transpired in a quiet and orderly manner, he would be woefully wrong. Quite the reverse. They were accompanied by an uninterrupted exchange of compliments in which everybody indulged and which threw serious doubts upon the ancestry of everyone in the crowd and not a few who were absent. Some of the epithets applied were of that peculiarly unique description which baffles ordinary language to express and which defy paraphrase. Suffice it to say that all the Billingsgate at hand and in mind was called upon to express the respective attitudes of the fighters toward one another. Allen, it would appear, squared off and was \"downed\" by Daly, while \"Dutchy\" and Hearne were punished by Charley. To put it in the words of an eyewitness who described it this morning, \"it was a caution to see Dutchy and Hearne carry the mail when Charley lit onto 'em.\"\n\n\"Now if you listen,\" said Dan to-day, \"I'll tell you how the thing occurred. You see I was standing before my door when suddenly I see three fellows doing a sort of peek-a-boo act around the cigar sign at the corner. Pretty soon they started down our way, and as they passed us one of 'em said: 'I ain’t going to let any —— —— —— —— do me up.' Just then down came Allen, with Dutchy and Hearne, and they stopped when they got up with us. Then Allen said: 'Them’s the —— —— Daly, ——, the —— ——.' Now you see I didn’t like that kind of talk and I went up to Allen and said: 'See here, Tom, that ain’t fair, you know.' Charley then come out and Allen said: 'Why —— you. I got two Dutchmen here that can lick any ——.' With that Charley up and said he could lick both of 'em and then Allen let go at Charley. Charley then told me to look after Allen and he'd take care of Dutchy and Hearne and he did it. Well, Tom put up his hands and said, 'Oh, what a nap I've got. This here fellow thinks he's a fighter!' Well, I gave him one in the stomach and he put down his hands to protect himself. Then I said, 'Tom, look out for your stomach!' and smashed him in the jaw. He fell like a rock and squealed for mercy like a stuck pig. After he was down I hit him a couple of punches in the face, and let him lay there until the Sergeant picked him up.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Bob Farrell, \"he begged for mercy when he was down. 'For God's sake Dan, quit, quit, quit!' That's what he said.\"\n\nMeanwhile Charley pursued the other two Allen adherents. \"Dutchy\" got away successfully, but Hearne showed a black eye this morning as the result of the fight. The number of blows which Daly gave the big ex-champion varies according to the different stories. One man says that Dan hit him three times in the abdomen and twice in the face, and another that four blows were administered on the abdomen and three on the face. They all agree, however, that Allen was knocked out and asked Daly to quit. \"I've quit fighting,\" added Dan, when he had finished his story, \"but if Allen wants to fight I’ll fight him every day in the week for fun. If I had been living when he was young there never would have been an ex-champion named Allen.\"\n\nThe ex-champion himself was found at his \"free-and-easy\" on Market street. Beyond an abrasion on the left jaw, another on the right ear and a slightly black eye he did not show much effect of the punishment. \"Why,\" said he, \"that was the funniest thing you ever saw. You see I was standing on the corner of Seventh street and Daly came up to me and began to talk about fightin’. Some words was passed, when somebody hit me in the back, and then I squared off. Daly says he got me, did he? Why, he backed up in front of his door before me, and, so help me, I think a whole theater was out. About fifty of 'em came out and jumped on me. There was too many of 'em to hurt me. All of a sudden some one tripped me by my foot and I fell down, and then the gang jumped on me and kicked me. This thing, though, ain't over yet by a long shot.\"\n\nAllen and Charley Daly were taken to the station and gave bond. When they appeared in the Police Court this morning the case was continued until Thursday at Allen’s request. The Daly brothers claim that it was jealousy at their success that led Allen to make the attack on them and further say that Tom will find them ready whenever he feels like fighting again.",

    text: "The impromptu mill which took place early Sunday morning between the Allen and Daly prize-fighters was aired before Judge Cady this morning, Tom Allen, Charley Daly, and John Ryan being up on counter charges of disturbing the peace. Not much light was thrown on the affair, both sides testifying diametrically opposed. The Daly faction had the preponderance of testimony, and their witnesses told a more connected story and corroborated each other better than did Allen’s witnesses, who were woefully defective in their statements as to how the trouble originated. The Daly story was to the effect that three men ran down Seventh street, pursued by Tom Allen, John Ryan, \"Dutchy\" Neal, and Steve Hearne. Allen came up and abused Dan Daly, who was sitting on the steps in front of his place. He called Daly vile names and pronounced him and his gang of Irish prize fighters no good. Dan remonstrated with him and Charley came out to pacify the ex-champion of the world. When he did, Allen remarked, “I 'ave two Dutchmen 'ere and either one of 'em can lick you.\" Charley replied that he could lick them both, whereupon Allen struck him. Then Charley told Dan to take care of the ex-champion of the world and he would attend to the other two. Charley testified that he started for Allen’s two \"Dutchmen,\" Neal and Hearne, but had to run them two blocks to get a punch at them. When he came back, Dan had knocked down Allen and the latter had cried enough. Charley got Dan to let Allen up.\n\nAllen, an employee of the Dalys, testified that when Charley told Dan to attend to Allen, the latter said: \"He’d 'ave a bloody puddin’ in you.\" Dan sailed in and knocked Allen off his pins, while in the language of Harry Allen, Charley made the other two sneak, running one as far as Tom Kelly's, while the other ran into Allen’s place.\n\nJohn Ryan, a young Englishman who was with Allen, gave his testimony in a very funny manner. He showed a disposition to wrestle with words which were too large for him and threw him. In a most graphic manner, he described how he and Allen fought a whole army of Daly pugilists, while Hearne and \"Dutchy\" Neal were beating a retreat. Not another witness who took the stand had seen Ryan in the fight. They saw him come up with Allen and saw no more of him until he came up the street with a baseball bat after the fight was all over and the police had arrived. Neither did he have a single mark after his dreadful battle with the fighters. Allen had a bloodshot eye, a cut and discolored ear, and a bruise on the side of the face. He said the fight started at Seventh and Market streets, and that Charley Daly commenced it by coming up and telling \"Dutchy\" Neal that he could lick him. A crowd set on \"Dutchy,\" who ran, and the ex-champion said Bob Farrell tripped him while Dan Daly and a whole crowd kicked him while he was down. \"They 'ad a putty lively foot-ball match wid me for awhile,\" explained Allen. \"When the fight commenced Dan Daly went back and rang 'is door-bell and a crowd poured out of that place like the letting out of a theater, and every bloody one of them 'ad a kick at me. There was too many of them to 'urt me. My ribs were kicked, and if you don’t believe it I’ll take off my clothes and show you.\"\n\nJudge Cady said the testimony was very mixed and he would fine the defendants $10 each.",

It will be remembered that at the time of the Daly-Allen mill Ryan was Allen’s friend. At the trial, it developed that Ryan saw no one doing any fighting but himself, and no one but himself saw him doing any fighting. Allen, it appears, tired of the young man and ordered him to keep away from his saloon. Ryan would not do so, and the ex-champion of the world administered a terrible beating to him. The young Englishman then went off and returned in a while with an arm full of stones which he sent crashing through the windows of Allen's saloon. This morning when Ryan appeared in court his face presented a terrible sight. His nose was mashed and his lips so badly swollen that he could scarcely speak. In his usual graphic tough language, he described the fight between Allen and himself: “Yer see, I wuz standin’ hin front hov of Mr. Hallen’s saloon with ha couple hov spootin’ friends hov mine, when some bloomin’ sucker comes hout hand swipes me hin de juw.

    text: "Nearly every prize-fighter of experience has hematoma. Boxers who work hard always have it. In their cases, it doesn't mean insanity, but mighty hard knocks. Among the insane, the New York Neurological Society met in the Academy of Medicine in that city lately and entertained five prize-fighting gentlemen. Perhaps that is putting it too strongly. The members of the society are physicians, and they didn’t invite the slugging gentlemen; they hired them to come around and lend the society their ears for a consideration. The fighters had a fine time just the same, and they all appeared to enjoy the reading of certain deeply learned neurological papers, including that one which taught them some new and startling things about themselves. They never knew nor even dreamed that they were suffering from hematoma, which is to say hematoma auris, which being interpreted means \"the insane ear.\" But they were, just the same, and the aural specimens they submitted were beauties, as a careful scanning of the pictures in this column will show.\n\nThe Neurological Society was having an interesting discussion on hypertrophy and atrophy when the fighters came in. Dr. Mathew D. Field, who had engaged them, was at the door awaiting their arrival. After a long time, they came mildly in and, with much self-repression and a good deal of scuffing of feet, they finally arranged themselves on a row of five camp-stools and sat bolt upright with much dignity. They assumed an air of profound interest in the learned remarks on atrophy and nodded wisely over a spirited debate on hypertrophy (with specimens). They all did very nicely, especially Tom Allen, the big middleweight. Tom was sleepy. His head wobbled as the head of one without hope. It fell to the right, to the left, forward and backward, thereby causing much laughter and many nudgings among his professional brethren, none of which disturbed his slumber.\n\nDr. Field is the first physician who has ever exhibited a number of living prize-fighters in order that savants might twiddle their (the fighters’) ears in the interests of science. For generations, physicians have ascribed the sort of ears shown in these pictures to insanity. Prize-fighters so rarely come under physicians’ care that their aural peculiarities seem never to have attracted attention. Little Joe Fowler used to be the featherweight champion of England, and he has been in many hard-fought battles. A hard, right-handed swinging blow landed on his left ear while he was trying to pound a fellow-citizen in a ring, about eleven years ago, and caused it to swell and turn outward like the handle on a jug. Five years later, his right ear was caught in the same manner with a hot left-handed swing, and it, too, puffed out. Repeated blows since then have added to the beauty of the swelled ears until now Joey can congratulate himself on having the prettiest pair in this country. While Dr. Field was reading his paper, the fighters felt of their ears frequently and opened their eyes and mouths widely, as who should say, \"I am badly rattled.\"\n\nThe doctor said that Dr. Frederick Bird of the Insane Asylum at Sieburg was the first to call attention to this curious condition of the insane (hematoma), in 1833. Since then, many physicians had reported cases of permanently swollen ears, a very few of which were found among the sane. For some time, the occurrence of these strange ears was not ascribed to violence. Dr. Field read: \"It is generally believed that the frequent occurrence of this disease among the insane is due to tropic changes, and the experiments of Brown-Sequard and Claude Bernard are cited as having a bearing upon these cases. A few observers have held that though there might have been a predisposition or susceptibility existing, yet the most prominent cause was external violence. The larger number of cases reported seem to have occurred on the left side, and this fact has been urged by the believers in the traumatic origin of the trouble to be due to the fact that a blow received from a right-handed individual would be most likely to fall for mechanical reasons upon the left side of his antagonist, while those holding the opposite view have accounted for this on the ground that the left carotid artery is nearer the heart and comes directly from the aorta, and therefore there is a more powerful circulation on the left side of the head than on the right.\n\n\"Statistics seem to indicate that it occurs more frequently among males than among females. Hun, who reports twenty-four cases from the records of the State Asylum at Utica, found twenty-three males and but one female. My friend Dr. Dent of the City Asylum writes me that he has nineteen cases now in the asylum, sixteen unilaterals and three bilaterals; this out of a total number of 1,672 female patients. He believes that hematoma occurs more frequently among females than males, and places the ratio as five to three. Hematoma has generally been looked upon as a grave complication when occurring among the insane. Hun remarks that it accompanies those forms of insanity which are essentially chronic or incurable, and consequently its presence indicates a very unfavorable prognosis.\"\n\nHaving quoted the above and many other well-known authorities who believe the swelled ear to be an accompaniment of insanity, Dr. Field spoke of a recently discovered statue of ancient Grecian make, representing a boxer wearing the cestus, who sits resting between the rounds. His ears are swollen and bear a close resemblance to those whose pictures adorn this column. Men who fought with the cestus were fond of using the swinging or round-arm blow, and doubtless the cuffs they bestowed on the sides of one another's heads brought on hematoma as boxers, and sometimes football players, get it today. Dr. Field mentioned a few cases that had been reported years ago among sane men, and in nearly every instance, violence was the cause.\n\nThe fighting men seemed hurt at finding they were associated with insanity. One lightweight fighter of some reputation was absent, after having promised to come and show his ears. One of the doctors had once treated him in an asylum for alcoholic dementia, and he was ashamed of the prospect of being pointed out as an ex-lunatic and couldn’t be induced to be present. He has been sent up to Blackwell’s Island a score of times, and his sudden exhibition of pride and coyness was a psychic problem of much interest to the doctors. However, they called upon Messrs. Fowler, Barnes, McHugh, McCormick, and Allen to come forward and show their ears. They did so with pride and alacrity. Hematoma, technically known to the fancy as \"big lug,\" is a mark of honor that ranks next to a broken nose.",

    text: "Nothing short of a miracle can now be done to bring off the Daly-McManus fight. There is now no doubt that the money will be turned over to the two sides by the stakeholder, Bill Clark, and this will in all probability be done tomorrow. Dan Daly is staying at his house on Walnut Street, and Charley Woods, his friend and trainer, has given up the training quarters at Tower Grove and has again taken up his abode in the city. Daly has quit training and is fully determined upon the course which he outlined in the Sunday Post-Dispatch of yesterday. Clark called at the Daly Bros’ place of business yesterday and said there that he would so arrange it that the fight would be brought off, but this is hardly possible. Daly is disgusted and so are his friends, and it is at their instance that he has given the affair up. He said this morning: \"After I fought with Eddie Kelly I swore I would never fight again, and I meant it. McManus knew this and took advantage of it by bluffing and challenging me in the theaters. He played his bluff and was called down, and he got Tom Allen mixed up in it, too. Both of them were sorry after they got in and then went to work to get out of it the best way they could. Of course, McManus says he’s willing to fight, but he knows there’s no danger of a fight now and he can go ahead and blow. I will pay no more attention to him. I'm done fighting now forever.\"\n\n\"If McManus agreed to fight and started out to the battle ground,\" said Woods, \"he would be arrested on the road to the train. It would be the easiest thing in the world to stop the fight, and there's no use bothering with it any longer.\"\n\nA very well-known man in the business is said to have stated that Allen put up the first $250 forfeit, and that other parties were to put up the balance. When the time came for the second deposit the parties were not forthcoming, and in order to save the $250 already up Allen made the second deposit. When the time arrived for the third deposit the parties were still absent and then Allen put that up also, and so on until the entire $1,000 was deposited, and Mr. Allen was face to face with the situation defined by the words \"fight or forfeit.\" If he fought he would lose, or was convinced that he would lose, and if he forfeited he would be just $1,000 poorer. These were the considerations, which, it is said, the well-known man in the business stated, induced the fat and festive Thomas to stick on technicalities and this opinion seems to be so unanimous among all except Tom himself that there should be some truth in it.\n\nThe man who regrets most that the fight is off is Mr. Charles Augustus Woods, whose science and experience had put Daly in fine fettle. Charley engineered Dan through a very long mill on one occasion and he would have keenly appreciated seeing his man whip the stranger from Kansas City. Besides, Charley will miss the little \"chunk of chink,\" as he calls it, which he would have got if Dan won.\n\nThe training expenses of the Daly party amounted to about $350, but Daly says the work has done him that much good. He was at it five weeks.",

    text: "The St. Louis County authorities are after the parties who figured in the recent Kelly-McManus fight at Florissant. This morning, Deputy Sheriff Price of St. Louis County arrived at the Four Courts with a warrant for prize-fighting against Ed Kelly and Hugh McManus, the principals in the fight, and Tom Kelly, Tom Allen, Charley Woods, Jim Sweeney, and Walter Brown, the referee, seconds, etc., in the fight. The warrant was issued by Justice Caffrey of St. Louis County. Price took it to Judge Noonan, who approved the warrant, it being made out in proper form. Detective McGrath was assigned to assist Price make the arrests, and they both left the Four Courts building shortly before noon to search for the fighters and their aiders and abettors.\n\nArrests were made at the time of the Kelly-Daly fight, but nothing ever came of them. If the St. Louis County officials handle the fighters as tenderly as the men did each other, neither Kelly nor McManus will be much punished.\n\nTom Reynolds and John Fletcher are also charged in the warrant as accessories. Tom Allen, Tom Kelly, Ed Kelly, Charley Woods, Tom Reynolds, Walter Brown, and Jim Sweeney were arrested by 2 o'clock this afternoon and all gave bond. McManus and Fletcher are still at large, but will probably be caught before night. The arrests were made by Detectives Hogan and Fitzgerald. The bonds are for $500 each.",

    text: "A large delegation of St. Louis sports, among them Tom Allen, the ex-champion of the world; Fred Watkins, his old backer; Tom Kelly, the ex-champion middleweight, and Dan Daly, middleweight champion of the State, will leave here about a week from Saturday to attend the Sullivan-Kilrain mill. There has been considerable betting done here on the fight, but it has all been private, none of the pool-rooms selling on it. Sullivan is the popular public favorite and has the call in the betting. In most instances where money has been put up, the big fellow’s backers have given odds on their man, and some bets have been made where the odds have been extremely large. Sullivan enthusiasts have also made wagers on the number of rounds it will take him to knock out Kilrain, and in some of these bets, the champion will have to knock out his man in short order to win for his admirers. Among those who are posted on ring matters, there is a difference of opinion as to who will win the battle.\n\nTom Kelly, who seconded Paddy Ryan when the latter fought Sullivan at Mississippi City, remarked to a POST-DISPATCH representative: \"As I have never seen Kilrain fight, I do not like to express an opinion of how this mill will result. Sullivan is the choice among the people generally, who think he will have an easy time winning. Well, now, I don’t think he will have any walk-over. The thinking men do not believe there is any cinch for him in this fight. There has been some betting done here on the battle. I hold one stake of $500 a side. I also hold a number of small wagers, and in most of these, odds have been given on Sullivan. In some instances, the odds are as high as 2 to 1, but they are all small bets such as $10 to $5. When Paddy Ryan fought Sullivan, he was in no condition for a fight, and in any condition was no man to fight Sullivan. I have no way of judging what Kilrain can do except by his fight with Jem Smith. Taking it that the fight was on the square, he must be a good one, for Smith is the acknowledged champion of England and, but for the darkness coming on, Kilrain would have won. Mitchell fought Sullivan a draw, and Mitchell is not as good a man as Smith. That would indicate that Kilrain is the better man, providing Sullivan was in condition when he met Mitchell, which I do not think he was. I or Sullivan as a phenomenal fighter, and if Kilrain can whip him, he is certainly champion of the world. It’s likely to prove a hard fight. That is the only opinion I will venture.\"\n\nDan Daly said: \"Sullivan will win sure and win easily. I tell you the big fellow is a wonder, and when he is in condition, none of these fighters have any show with him, and I think he will be in condition for this fight. I will certainly put up on him all the money I can raise. In my opinion, Kilrain has no chance to win. I shall attend the fight.\"\n\nSaid Charley Daly: \"If that fight comes off, Sullivan will win. If the big fellow is in condition, he will whip Kilrain easily, and if not in condition, Sullivan’s backers, rather than take any chances on losing their money, will see that the fight does not proceed. Sullivan has greater size and strength than Kilrain, and there are none of them any more clever than the big fellow. This talk about him merely possessing brute strength is all bosh. He is as scienced as any fighter and has a rush which none of them have. Mind you, I don’t think that he will whip Kilrain in a punch, but I think less than fifteen rounds will settle the fight. One thing in Kilrain’s favor are his seconds, Charley Mitchell and Mike Donovan. Both are very cunning and know lots of points about Sullivan’s fighting which they can tip to Kilrain.\"\n\nBob Farrell, the lightweight, who traveled in Sullivan's first combination, remarked: \"If a man will stand up to Sullivan and fight, there is not a pugilist in the world who stands any chance with him. He is a wonder, and the only way they can possibly whip him is to out-general him. He is a big, impatient fellow, and they might get him to tire himself out just as Mitchell did with him, and then might whip him, but they can never do it otherwise. However, I think that Mitchell fight has been a lesson to John, and that they will not be able to fool him again. I certainly expect him to win.\"\n\nProf. Bill Clark, the Belfast Chicken, is a believer in Kilrain. \"I know both men well,\" he remarked, \"and the fight Kilrain made against that big Jem Smith stamps him as a splendid man. Sullivan came out at a time when there were no fighters and made his reputation in glove contests of a few rounds. He is a boxer and not a fighter. There is a vast difference between boxing Queensberry rules and fighting London Prize Ring rules. Sullivan never whipped any man in a fight except Paddy Ryan, who amounts to nothing. When he meets Kilrain, he will have the strongest opponent he ever had and a man who can fight London rules. Sullivan has not taken care of himself and is a big, stubborn fellow whom no one can make train, and he will not be able to stay. Of course, he may get in a chance blow and knock out Kilrain, but otherwise, I do not think he will win. I shall certainly put my money on Kilrain. It is doubtful whether the fight will ever be finished, however. They are very apt to break it up at the ring. Now you mark what I say.\"\n\nTom Allen remarked: \"Kilrain will win, sure. The people generally greatly overestimate Sullivan. He made reputation by going around the country sparring and knocking people out with gloves, but has never done anything in the ring except whip Paddy Ryan, who never could fight. This man Kilrain is a very clever fighter, or he could never have given Jem Smith the battle he did. He takes good care of himself and, I think, is a much better man than Sullivan under London prize ring rules. My money shall certainly be placed on Kilrain.\"\n\nFred Watkins stated: \"I am going to the fight with Tom Allen and Tom Kelly, and I shall back Kilrain. I think he will win because he knows much more about the London prize ring rules than Sullivan and is a better fighter under them. In Chicago, from which place I have just returned, I found everybody for Sullivan, but that does not change my opinion one whit. Sullivan is a sparrer, and not a fighter.\"\n\nHugh McManus remarked: \"I think Kilrain will win and have placed some money on him. The odds here are about 5 to 4 in Sullivan's favor, but the people, in my opinion, are mistaken in their judgment of the men. Sullivan is not the man he used to be, and it is questionable whether he ever was the man Kilrain is. Certain is that the big fellow has injured himself a great deal by his dissipation, and I do not think he is Kilrain’s equal. The latter is a great fighter, as his meeting with Smith clearly shows.\"\n\nHank Wider said: \"It will be a walk-over for Kilrain. At one time, Sullivan could whip any of them easily, but he can’t do it now. Dissipation has broken him down, and he is no longer fit for a fight. No man can drink and carouse as Sullivan has done and retain his strength and condition. It is against the laws of nature, and any man who does it inevitably falls.\"",

    text: "Several former stars of the ring are living in St. Louis. The present location and occupation of some of the old heroes of the prize ring will prove interesting reading to many. St. Louis is the home of several of the men once famous in the \"squared circle.\" Tom Allen, for several years champion heavyweight of America, now runs a saloon here on Market Street. In the same block with him is another saloon owned by Tom Kelly, who was once the middleweight champion of this country. Prof. Bill Clark, proprietor of the Natatorium, was once one of the most famous sparrers and fighters in America, while Bob Farrell, a former noted lightweight, who was a member of Sullivan’s first traveling combination, is instructor of sparring at the Pastime Athletic Club. Another old-time fighter in St. Louis is Owen Maloney, who battled in the lightweight class. He is employed in Kelly's saloon.\n\nNew York is a haven for veterans of the ring. Billy Madden, who makes his headquarters there, is a manager of pugilists, Peter Maher, the Irish champion, being his present protege. Billy Edwards, former lightweight champion, is a \"bouncer\" at Stokes’ fashionable Hoffman House bar. Mike Donovan and Dominick McCaffrey are instructors of sparring at the New York and Manhattan Athletic Clubs, and George Young, the English boxer, runs a school of manly art. Ned Price, the heavyweight who once fought a draw with the late Joe Coburn, is a criminal lawyer with a big practice. Big John Flood runs a saloon in New York. Poot Harris does odd jobs about a race track. Joe McAuliffe is a fireman and old Barney Aaron is a shouter of results for bookmakers at a race track. Jim Dunne, the Brooklyn heavyweight, is a politician and Joe Fowler, ex-champion featherweight of England, is in charge of a lunch counter in a Brooklyn saloon.\n\nJohnny Keating of Cincinnati, whose three hours’ battle to a draw with Dick Hellywood made him noted, is prosperous as a broker in Jersey City. Jim Donnelly, ex-heavyweight, swings a sledge in the Rogers’ Locomotive works at Paterson. Geo. Rooke, the tall middleweight, conducts a public house at Nyack. Patsy Brannigan, or \"Scotty,\" as he was called when he fought Dooney Harris for the lightweight championship, is pound-master in Sacramento. Peter Nolan is engaged as a successful saloon-keeper in Cincinnati. Tim Collins is in a lunatic asylum at Boston. Ardy Hanley, featherweight, was in New York up to a couple of weeks ago, when he changed his base to Philadelphia, and is still there making a living.\n\nQuite a number of the old-timers have opened saloons, among them being Jack Turner, in Rochester; Harry Maynard and Paddy Ryan in San Francisco; Patsy Sheppard, in Boston, and Arthur Chambers in Philadelphia.\n\nJem Mace is the same gypsy as of old, and fights from place to place in search of gold. He has been to Australia, Africa, and other countries, and is now in England managing an African fighter.\n\nJack Fogarty is a constable in Philadelphia, but is so devoted to the sport of sparring that he has organized a club called The Ariel in the City of Brotherly Love, and sees to it that no good contest comes off without his attendance.\n\nWillie Clark, who gave Ike Weir twenty-two of the hardest sort of rounds, is at work in the Reading yard of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Co.\n\nMike Cleary, once a blacksmith, is still good enough to spar with John L. Sullivan in training work, travels in combinations as both boxer and wrestler.\n\nBilly McLean left pugilism to become a baseball umpire, but now makes a book at the Gloucester race track.\n\nLen Hogan, whose only fame was gained by being matched against Tom Allen in a scheme arranged to rob the latter and his backers, and which plot was carried out by a crowd of toughs, is now traveling about the country as the \"reformed prize-fighter evangelist.\"\n\nFully three thousand sporting men witnessed the prize fight to a finish with skin gloves between Tom Callaghan of England and Willie Kenny of Jersey City last night at a resort on Long Island. Only three rounds were fought, but they proved enough, as Kenny was no match for the English champion. Both men went at each other as though their lives depended on the issue. There was no chance to see who was doing the best work until the latter part of the round, when first blood was claimed by Callaghan’s seconds and was allowed. Some very hard blows were struck by both men, but the Englishman was cool and did not strike unless he had a good opening. When he did let go with either hand it was with telling effect. They came together repeatedly in the second round and each time they clinched the referee had to separate them. Toward the latter part of the round Callaghan commenced getting in his heavy work, and on a clean right-hander, he sent Kenny to the floor. This advantage he kept up, and before the close of the round he knocked Kenny down twice more.\n\nWhen the third round was commenced, Kenny was a trifle groggy, but he proved himself game, even though he was knocked out within a half minute.\n\nThe general impression was that Callaghan was the man to be matched against Dixon, the colored featherweight champion of the world.\n\nA morning paper announced that the mighty pugilist, John L. Sullivan, has decided to go to Dwight, Ill., and submit to the bi-chloride of gold for drunkenness.\n\nBilly Plimmer, who claims to be the champion 110-pound man of the world, and Kid Hogan were matched to fight ten rounds for $300 a side, the contest to take place during the second week in January.\n\nA farewell dinner was tendered Frank Slavin by his London admirers yesterday. During the evening the Australian stated that he would endeavor to make a match with Sullivan as soon as he reached America and that he would fight anywhere barring New Orleans. Charley Mitchell also stated that he would punch Jim Corbett’s head as soon as possible.\n\nDan J. Barleff, who claims to be the middleweight champion of Ohio, has posted a forfeit of $200 to meet John A. Sullivan of New Jersey. Barleff will undertake to knock Sullivan out in five rounds.\n\nThomas O'Rourke, backer and manager of George Dixon, says that the latter will not go to England to fight Fred Johnson unless the match is made upon the following conditions: The purse to be £1,000, or $5,000, and a stake of £1,000, or $3,900, a side. Both men to weigh at 8 stone 4 pounds (116 pounds) at the ringside on the afternoon of the day set for the contest, and the National Club to allow Dixon £100 for expenses. If these terms suit the National Club and Johnson, the match can be ratified without delay. This is the ultimatum in the matter.\n\nJimmy Kennard, known as the \"St. Paul Kid,\" has accepted the challenge made by Billy Plimmer, the champion 110-pound Englishman, and will fight him as soon as arrangements can be perfected."

When I was over there in 1882 I had the pleasure of participating, and it was one of the happiest periods of my life.” Tom and his two are all that is left of the Allen Clan. “Both of my girls,” said the veteran “are married; one of them resides in the old country and the other endeavors to make my last days comfortable at home,” and the champion leaned back in his chair and gave the interviewer a knowing wink. “However,” said he, “I expect to celebrate a good many birthdays yet.” It was the ex-champion’s intention to give his friends a banquet yesterday but he was up so late Friday evening receiving congratulations that he decided to abandon the scheme. “I will do it next year, though,” said he, “whether they keep me up late or not.”"

For more than fifty years, less changes have been made in the Market Street shops than in the buildings on any other business streets for more than thirty years past.\n\n\"Bits of Old St. Louis\" would have been a very prolific subject five years ago, when everything was old in this city, but today it is quite different, as the homes which looked old then have either assumed new phases, or they have nearly all been wiped out of existence within the last half of a decade. The sites they occupied only a short time since are adorned by grand and costly commercial buildings. Indeed, columns could easily be written about the rookeries and the fabulous rents they produced on inside lots and at commanding corners where now stand the best buildings in the city, every one of them built within the past five years. Many other old landmarks have been torn away during the past year, and the places where they stood are now the scene of active building operations for the construction of eight to fourteen-story palatial business blocks, the erection of which will cost all the way from $300,000 to $1,000,000 each. The city is improving at a very rapid pace. The demand for more business apartments is constantly increasing. Large commercial buildings have proven most profitable investments in St. Louis, and with the growing demand for other improvements of this character, the rookeries are fast disappearing.\n\nThe only frame structure left in the business section is on Market Street at the northwest corner of the alley between Sixth and Seventh Streets. It is a two-story building, sway-backed by the snow of more than fifty winters and warped by as many summer suns. Old as it is, this house harmonizes very well with its present surroundings, for the block it fronts on is, taken as a whole, the most wretched looking square in all the city. It occupies ground which has enhanced in value from comparatively nothing to upwards of a fortune.\n\nThe site in the business center has become so valuable it is now no uncommon thing to see apparently substantial structures of two to four stories in height torn down to make room for new and more imposing improvements. Five years ago, work of this nature in St. Louis was viewed very reproachfully and with a feeling that such destruction bordered close on vandalism. Expressions of this kind were frequently heard when the Jaccard Building, a very fine stone-front, of quite pretentious architecture, too, was torn down to make way for new developments."

    text: "The indications for St. Louis for today are fair; cooler today; warmer Wednesday.\n\nTom Kelly, America's ex-middleweight champion, who was one of the most active promoters, is again explaining to his friends how the mighty John L. met defeat last Wednesday night. Kelly's friends in this city were enthusiastic Sullivan men, and they can't understand how in the world a comparatively unknown man, such as Corbett was at the time Sully concluded to notice him, could go in and polish off the only John L. in such a masterly manner.\n\n\"You would be surprised,\" said Kelly, \"at the number of intelligent observers of the ring who ask me seriously whether John L. did not throw the contest. It is a ridiculous theory, yet among certain circles it seems to be a universal opinion. They were not present and did not see the champion's condition and the manner in which this man Corbett outclassed him. There is the key to Sully's downfall.\n\n\"I have known John L. Sullivan for many years and have seen him fight all his big battles, excepting the one with Mitchell in France. In his contest with Paddy Ryan on the Trojan, personally I will admit I have never been an enthusiastic admirer of him. As a fighter, however, I have always admired him. Sullivan is as square and honest a man as possible in the ring, and no one who knows him well believes anything to the contrary. Before I left the city I was doubtful as to the result, and when I saw the champion I became more so than ever. He was not in condition to meet Corbett, and it was due, I believe, to himself and his advisers preaching his invincibleness. I came to the conclusion then that no man, not even excepting Sullivan, could whip Corbett. The Californian is invincible. I saw the Californian put $5,000 down about six months ago, and I made up my mind then that he was the coming champion. I have seen him fight, and I know what he can do.

    text: "St. Louis has at various times harbored within her hospitable gates many shining lights of the pugilistic fraternity. Before San Francisco and New Orleans came into prominence and overshadowed all the rest of the Union, the Mound City could almost be said to vie with New York and Boston as a pugilistic Mecca. She has at various times had the honor to reckon among her citizens the holders of championship honors, and though none of them have shed such effulgence on their native town as the man from Boston, there was a time when the eyes of every Knight of the Fives were turned to this city, which was at that time the home of champions. That was in the days when McCoole, Allen, Kelly, Chambers, and Madden had set up their household gods in the Future Great and were pursuing the even tenor of their ways with much public support and little interference from bluecoats.\n\nAll this was way back in the 70s, and old-timers can remember well the frequent trips by boat to Bloody Island to witness a scrap between local buffers, and the journeys up and down the river to the great championship fights that took place near the city. In those days, the principals did not travel to the appointed spot in luxurious equipages but were picked up from the river bank along the route like ordinary mortals. But delegations from other cities were not infrequent, and every big mill on the banks of the Mississippi was attended by sporting men from Chicago, Cincinnati, and New York. The most noted stars in the pugilistic firmament that have made St. Louis their home are Tom Allen, who at the time of his retirement was heavyweight champion of the world; Tom Kelly, the middleweight champion; Mike McCoole, at one time champion of America; Charles Daly, ex-lightweight champion of America.\n\nTom Kelly was born near the town of Castlerea in the County of Roscommon, Ireland, Nov. 10, 1838. In 1851, young Kelly, with his mother, three brothers, and a sister, crossed the channel and settled at Dewsbury in Yorkshire, where he went to work in a woolen factory. The boys about the place were fond of using the gloves, and Tom's cleverness soon made him \"cock of the mill.\" When 19 years of age, 5 feet 9½ inches in height, the cotton lads clubbed together and made up a purse to match Tom against a local champion named Johnny Moran. They met near Dewsbury and fought seventy-seven rounds in 1h. 55m. Kelly had the worst of the fight for the first hour, but he kept gamely on until the arrival of the police put an end to the fighting. When he met Moran two years after, he came out with flying colors after a brief contest. Tom then adopted the custom of that time, traveling about and boxing at the various races and fairs. Tom married about this time and was bent on quitting the ring, but his friends would not have it that way and put up £25 for a match between him and Jim Connor of Leeds. They met at Dewsbury Oct. 1, 1860. Tom whipped his man in fifty-eight minutes. After this, Kelly joined a boxing company run by Mickey Bent and was carded to fight any novice in England at 146 pounds. Fifteen months elapsed before his next battle. On Dec. 24, 1861, the day before Christmas, known in England as boxing day, he fought Dan Lomas at Staleybridge. After seventy-seven minutes of fighting, with Kelly the favorite all through, Lomas adopted the dropping game and lost the fight by going down without being hit. A fresh match was made for Feb. 4, 1863. After eluding the police all day, the men met late in the afternoon and Lomas lost the fight through the identical offense which lost him the first match, after forty-six rounds had been fought. On Sept. 22, 1863, he met Bill Brown, Lomas' old conqueror, for £100 a side. The men met at Aldershot, Jem Mace seconding Kelly. The boy from Castlerea went at his opponent hammer-and-tongs and punched him out in seven rounds. Tom was then matched to meet Jack Rooke for £100 a side. The odds were largely in Rooke’s favor, and he was tempted by the gamblers to throw down the fight. Kelly was not in on the game. The men met at Thames Haven Feb. 14, 1865. After six rounds had been fought, with everything in Kelly's favor, Bob Brettle, one of Rooke’s seconds, broke into the ring and struck his man, then afterward pulled up one of the stakes and belabored him with it. Kelly was awarded the stakes, but the bets were declared off. Kelly, to show that he had no knowledge of the fight being crooked, offered to fight Rooke the same week for £200 a side, but Rooke declined. They met a second time on April 25, 1865, and Tom was put out in the thirteenth round. He then took a breathing spell of seventeen months before he was pitted against Harry Allen, a brother of Tom's, for £50 a side. They met at Flouch Sept. 28, 1866. The fight was a terrific one, both men having to be carried from the ring. Kelly’s nose was broken and both eyes closed. He stood up to his antagonist for thirty-six rounds before he was put out. On March 5, 1867, Tom met Dick Radley at Clapham Commons. Kelly had the best of it for eleven rounds when the police interfered. The referee ordered the fight on for the next day, but Richard had enough. After this fight, Kelly sold out his goods and chattels and sailed for America, landing in New York Jan. 11, 1868. He challenged unsuccessfully any 150-pound man in the country. After traveling on a sparring exhibition tour, Tom settled in this city. Here he was backed for a local favorite, Fred Bussey, who had defeated Andy Duffy and \"Soap\" McAlpine. Tom Allen seconded Bussey. The fight lasted twenty-seven rounds, and though Kelly was almost whipped at the start, his gameness won him the fight. This was his first and last fight in his adopted country, for though he challenged any middleweight in the world, he met with no response. He then retired from the ring but has acted as second in many fights, the most notable of which was the Sullivan-Ryan battle, when Tom was in the Trojan’s corner.\n\nTom Allen, the retired champion of the world, has been for years a resident of this city. He keeps a saloon called the Champion’s Rest, which is quite a resort for lovers of the fighter’s art. The championship cap of England is one of the most revered ornaments of the place. Tom Allen was born at Birmingham, England, Apr. 23, 1840. He commenced fighting when only twenty years of age. In those days, big purses were not in fashion, as some of the stakes Tom did battle for will testify. His first battle was with a punster named White, whom he met on April 20, 1860. The fight for £5 a side resulted in Tom's favor after ten minutes. His record for the next seven years he remained in England is as follows:\n\nFought a draw with Nobby Hall Sept. 7, £5 a side; 40m. Fifteen rounds.\n\nBeat Morris Conner March 20, 1861, £10 a side; 1h. 10m. Sixteen rounds.\n\nBeat Jack Gould June 8, 1861, £15 a side; 50m.\n\nBeat Posh Price July 28, 1862, £10 a side; 50m. Thirty-five rounds.\n\nBeat Bingy Rose Jan. 28, 1864, £25 a side; 20m.\n\nBeaten by Bob Smith, June 2, 1864, £5 a side; 59m. Fifty rounds.\n\nBeat Jack Parkinson, June 13, 1865, £25 a side; 23m. Eleven rounds.\n\nBeat Posh Price, Nov. 28, 1865, £25 a side; 2h. 5m. Forty-one rounds.\n\nBeat George Iles, June 13, 1866, £25 a side; 1h. 2m. Seventeen rounds."

Accompanied by Jack Wilkes, who has agreed to furnish the stake for Johnnie in a contest with Niel, they called at this office yesterday afternoon and offered to put up the entire $500 then and there. Before doing so, however, it was thought best to call on Tom Allen, who, according to Niel, would back him, and find out whether Niel’s statement was correct. Allen, when informed what Niel had said, stated that \"Dutch\" exaggerated matters considerably. \"I told him,\" said Tom, \"that I would give $50 towards a purse for such a contest, but he certainly had no grounds for putting me down as saying I would furnish a $500 side bet for him. I would like to see 'Dutch' and Johnnie brought together, but I am not prepared to wager $500 on the result.\" This satisfied Wilkes and the Dalys, all three of whom were convinced that it is impossible for Niel to get backing to the extent of $500 in this city.\n\n\"If 'Dutch' can, however,\" said Wilkes, \"all he has to do is to make known the fact to me and a match can be readily made. I am friendly to both boys, but I look upon this affair as a matter of business and am prepared to take $500 worth of chances that Johnnie can put out Niel.\"\n\n\"Dutch,\" when seen in reference to the matter, said; \"I now see that I have been placed in a very improper light. I was given to understand that Allen would furnish a stake for me in a contest with Johnnie Daly and started out to get one on. I can defeat the latter, however, and I will try and see if I can secure someone else who will furnish the stake, so that I can get an opportunity to prove what I have said.\"",

The child wears a little blue gown; a broad scarlet ribbon about her waist is stamped, “Given to the Lord.”\n\n“A Salvationist,” says some one with a sneer, “selling her papers.”\n\nShe enters the door and asks the first man whom she meets to buy The War Cry.\n\n“Clear out,” he answers roughly; “I want my nickel for whiskey.”\n\nShe looks at him quietly, saying, “God bless you, sir,” and passes on.\n\nSome young fellows stand near, and one of them cries out:\n\n“We'll buy your papers if you'll sing for us.”\n\nThe woman hesitates; she has visited saloons before—indeed, that is one of her regular Saturday night duties in the selling of her papers,—but she has never been asked to sing.\n\nThe soldier sees the opportunity, however, and answers quietly:\n\n“I'll sing a hymn if you like, sir.”\n\n“Sing, ‘Nearer, my God, to Thee,’” calls out some one.\n\nAnd clear and sweet above the clink of glasses, the click of dice, the soft thud of rapidly dealt cards and the whirr of talk, the hymn rises:\n\n“Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee, E’en though it be a cross That raiseth me, Still all my song shall be, Nearer, my God, to Thee, Nearer to Thee.”\n\n“Sing us another,” calls out the first voice.\n\nThis time it is one of the Salvation Army songs, and this its chorus:\n\n“You are drifting, drifting to your doom, But there’s mercy still for you, but there’s mercy still for you.”\n\nThe little girl, frightened at first, begins to sing with her mother.\n\n“Tell you what, boys,” calls out one of the young fellows, “we'll all sing with her, if she'll sing ‘Hold the Fort,’” and they do.\n\nAnd then they crowd around, and each takes a War Cry.\n\n“I don’t call any man a gentleman who looks out for any change,” says one man.\n\nOne of the barkeepers hands the child a sandwich. She is very hungry and sets her little white teeth quickly upon it, when she remembers something.\n\n“Thank God for a good dinner,” she says, looking down. Her mother turns to go out; just then a man speaks to her:\n\n“I should think you'd be afraid to come here with your child, aren’t you?”\n\n“Oh no,” she answers simply as she goes by him.\n\nShe does not speak to any one except a young boy who stands by the door. He sang with such a beautiful voice and he is so young, she cannot pass him by.\n\n“I wish, sir,” she says, “that voice was singing in God’s service.”\n\nHe does not answer and they go out into the bitter night, a long walk before them to the cheerless barracks; part of the way she will carry the little girl.\n\n“Good heavens, Jack!” says one of the young fellows, “what gives that woman courage enough to come here? She was as pale as death; I know she was frightened.”\n\n“I don’t know, old fellow. She’s a good woman, sure. What do you say to going home?”"

    text: "The fault with most authors who try to write stories about city life is that they have caught only a glimpse of their subject, and think it is the whole. People who write about the slums are especially prone to err in this way. The low life of a city cannot be described by one who has visited the abodes of squalor once or twice. The description may be exact, the language true to the tongue of the subject, though that is harder, but the story will lack the essence of the life that the author is trying to describe.\n\nHere is a very well printed little book by Annie Bronson King, published by D. D. Merrill of New York. It is called \"The Children of the Slums,\" and it contains a number of sketches of life in St. Louis. None of them are realistic, in spite of the author’s evident labor to make them so.\n\n\"Saturday night, and 9 o’clock at Tom Allen’s\" one of the sketches begins. A poor woman from the Salvation Army comes in, brings with her a little child and then rough men help her. The place described is not Tom Allen’s, and the woman does not behave like the women of the Salvation Army. The sketch is pathetic, but no more like a scene from real life than one of T. S. Arthur’s descriptions in \"Ten Nights in a Bar Room.\"\n\nYet the sketches are well done, the description is sharp and clear and the interest of the reader is caught and held. The author has much more to learn about life than about writing."

    text: "Six weeks ago, a canvass by mail on the probable results of the fights at New Orleans was conducted. One hundred sporting oracles were consulted, and their opinions make interesting reading.\n\nThe canvass shows that the average American thinks Goddard will win his fight, and only eight of the 100 prognosticators pick Smith as a winner.\n\nGoddard-Smith—Ten think that Goddard should win in an unstated number of rounds, while two assert Smith should capture the honors. The estimates on rounds in Goddard's case vary from two to twenty-five rounds and on Smith from eight to thirty-seven.\n\nHall-Fitzsimmons—Four say that Fitz should win without predicting the number of rounds, while eleven pick Hall as the prospective winner of the $40,000 purse. The seers have Fitzsimmons the winner in from twelve to thirty-five rounds and Hall in from nine to sixty.\n\nIt must be remembered that the men giving the opinions are trained observers, and what they say has the weight of expert testimony. Some of the individual predictions on the series are here given:\n\nJames J. Corbett, heavyweight champion: \"Goddard, in six to eight rounds, 10 to 3 in favor of Goddard; Hall, ten to twelve rounds, 10 to 5 in favor of Fitzsimmons; Lewis, in the wrestling match, 10 to 8 in favor of Lewis.\"\n\nJim Hall, the middleweight: \"Goddard in six rounds; 1 to 6 in favor of Goddard.\" The aspirant for the world’s middleweight premiership then tips himself to win in about fifteen rounds, but insists that the betting should be 10 to 5 in favor of Bob Fitzsimmons. Lewis on an even-money proposition.\n\nAlex Greggains: \"Goddard in four to six rounds, at 10 to 4 in favor of Goddard. Hall in about twelve rounds at even money.\"\n\nBilly McCarthy of Australia, who fought both Hall and Fitzsimmons: \"Goddard, in eight rounds, 10 to 1 in favor of Goddard; Hall, thirteen rounds, 10 to 6 in favor of Hall. Lewis, at 10 to 8.\"\n\nJack Dempsey, the \"Nonpareil\": \"Goddard, seven rounds, at 10 to 5. Fitzsimmons, in twenty rounds, even betting. Lewis, at 11 to 6.\"\n\nPaddy Ryan, ex-heavyweight champion: \"Goddard in fifteen rounds, odds of 10 to 7 in favor of Goddard. Hall and Fitzsimmons are so evenly matched that it is impossible for me to decide in favor of either. The betting should be even. Lewis at 11 to 1.\"\n\nDominick C. O’Malley, New Orleans: Goddard, three, 5 to 1. Fitzsimmons, even. No opinion on the wrestlers.\"\n\nStanton Abbott, London: \"Hall in ten rounds, even.\"\n\nRobert Fitzsimmons: \"I hope to be in the race at the finish.\"\n\nFrank C. Ives, champion billiardist of the world: \"Hall, Goddard and Lewis.\"\n\nJacob Schaefer, ex-champion billiardist of the world: \"Goddard, Hall and Lewis.\"\n\nBilly Madden, manager and maker of champions: \"I pass.\"\n\nJack McAuliffe and Mike Mooney will be matched to fight this evening. According to agreement with Otto Floto, McAuliffe’s manager, the principals will meet at 6 o’clock this evening to sign articles. Mooney stated this morning that the articles of agreement as arranged by him and Manager Floto stipulated for a side stake of $2,700. The fight to come off within sixty days before the club offering the largest purse. The weight agreed upon will be the lightweight limit, 133 pounds, give or take two pounds. Both parties agree to post $500 or $1,000 forfeit money which will be sent in to the sporting editor of the New York World, who is to be the final stakeholder.\n\nMooney said this morning that because of the match he would not spar McAuliffe tonight as announced. \"A good many people,\" said he, \"think I am overreaching myself in going against McAuliffe, but I rely on the difference in our modes of fighting to pull me through. I am taller than he and as long in the reach. What I lack is his experience, and my unabused constitution is an offset for that. Mr. Floto says McAuliffe will get a good-sized purse for the fight, and you can see from the selection of the stakeholder that we both anticipate it will come off before the Coney Island Athletic Club. I expect that the loser will get some share of the purse. I have had a hard time to get the backing for this fight and $300 of the money that is going up tonight is my own.\"\n\nMcAuliffe spent the greater part of the day in bed and did not know of his manager’s action when a reporter visited him. He expressed great eagerness to meet Mooney and said that he was a big, strong, well-conditioned opponent. He also expressed the belief that Mooney could not train below 138 pounds. \"If he gets down to 133 I'll punch him full of holes,\" Jack said.\n\nThe Ryan-Dawson fight is off for the time being, and possibly forever.\n\nJust about this time last year Ryan broke up a once prosperous athletic club and caused thousands of Mardi-Gras and fistic carnival visitors no end of disappointment by \"going lame\" at the critical moment.\n\nHe has repeated the dose. Last year it was his throat; this year it is his ankle, but there are people here who are not backward about saying that it was his heart that troubled him in both instances.\n\nDawson went to the Olympic Club-house yesterday, weighed in and claimed his forfeit, which was allowed. This $500 is all he gets for the trouble and expense of training. Ryan’s friends have forsaken him and the Olympic officials say he is a Jonah. He will never again get a purse from a respectable club.\n\nEvan Lewis is here, slightly out of condition by reason of his wife's death, but sullen and determined. He will give Roeber a maniacal struggle this evening. Hinds and McMillan reached here this morning and are in good condition.\n\nTom Allen, America’s ex-heavyweight champion, has arrived in New Orleans to second Ed Smith in his coming contest with Joe Goddard, the Australian Barrier Champion. Allen handled and seconded Smith when he went against Peter Jackson in Chicago. On this occasion, it will be remembered, Smith made the colored champion of England and Australia sick, to say the least. They fought six rounds and Smith had the famous ebony-colored champion puffing and blowing like a steam engine at the end of the \"go.\" Peter, however, was far from being in condition to do himself justice, while Smith was trained to perfection. Allen is convinced that Smith could have put out the colored champion had he let at him a little longer. Tom is, of course, sure that Smith will defeat Goddard.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan’s pugilistic reverses have not warped his bigness of heart. While the ex-champion was standing in Ed Cuthbert’s saloon Monday afternoon, surrounded by a dense throng of worshippers, Bob Farrell, the old-time lightweight, edged his way up to him and was met with a warm grasp of the hand. Bob had traveled with Sullivan in both Joe Coburn’s and Billy Madden’s combinations.",

    text: "Austin Gibbons of Paterson, N. J., and Mike Daly of Bangor, Me., the well-known lightweights, will battle to a finish for a $3,500 purse in the arena of the Crescent City Club this evening. The contest is to be at 138 pounds, and both men are to weigh in at 3 o’clock this afternoon. Gibbons weighed just 141 pounds Sunday, but he expected to be able to rub the extra three pounds off in short order. Daly is near weight, strong and confident. Gibbons will probably be the favorite at the post, though it is even, each in private bets and 9 to 10 each in the poolrooms. Jim Gibbons and Alex Greggains will second Austin Gibbons and Capt. Daly and Folly Smith or Joe Choyinski will be behind Mike Daly. The latter’s reputation is based principally on a draw he made with Jack McAuliffe several years ago. Unsuccessful efforts have been made a number of times since this affair took place to bring the two together again. Daly is said, by those who ought to know what they are talking about, to be a quitter, and if such is correct his chances of being successful this evening can hardly be said to be rosy. No one doubts his cleverness, however, and in this respect he has the advantage of Gibbons. The Paterson boy is 5 feet 8½ inches. His chest measures neck 15½, waist 29, biceps 12, forearm 11, reach 27 inches. Since 14 years of age he has been boxing, and for the last three years he has been meeting all comers. He has successfully fought several battles with skin-tight gloves, and fought with the regulation gloves several good contests to a finish. He defeated Jim Verrall of England in four rounds, the contest lasting thirteen minutes. Andy Bowen of New Orleans also went down before him. He was defeated by McAuliffe in September, 1891, in six rounds at the Hoboken Club. On this occasion they stopped the contest at the end of 18 minutes when McAuliffe had the best of it and he, of course, got the decision. This, however, did not satisfy Gibbons, who has always claimed that had the authorities not interfered he would have had a chance of winning, on account of his power over McAuliffe to stand a long contest.\n\nTom Allen, the veteran ex-champion, who was behind Smith, says that the fight was fairly won. He had picked Smith before the fight because he knew that the man was clever and had a great right and felt that Goddard could be defeated if he was fought properly. There was no use in standing off and exchanging blows with the giant and there is no law to make a man fight Goddard that way. He told Smith to get his head into Goddard’s body if he could and to stick close all the time. He expected that Goddard would whip himself in time and Smith’s right could do the rest. Smith followed instructions and won the fight. The Smith party was jubilant and claimed that their man was a pugilist of the first-class on his merits. He had been neglecting himself and had lost fights by going into the ring without training, but had learned a lesson and would profit by it.\n\n“Did Bat Masterson win the fight?” was the significant query of a well-known local sport this morning, as a crowd of the dead game contingent discussed the result of the Goddard-Smith contest. “I think,” went on the speaker, answering his own question, “that he did. Just recall the dispatch that came up from New Orleans last week, in which Bat is quoted as saying that he knew Smith had a yellow streak in him, but that he would take the gaff if there was anybody in his corner to make him fight. Well, Bat went in his corner all right Friday night, and it’s reasonable to suppose that some great pressure was bearing on Smith to make him take the awful punching he got, for it's not a bit in his line. I'll bet a round just now that Bat and his gun played star parts in that game.”\n\n“This country,” said George Abingdon Baird, Charley Mitchell's backer, when in this city last week, “offers such large inducements for fighters that England and Australia have become depleted of boxers. Aside from Mitchell, Ted Pritchard was the best man at his weight in the old country and I really expected him to whip Hall. Jim is a fighter, though, and poor Ted stood little chance to win from him. He is a good, stiff puncher, deucedly clever with his head and hands and as shifty a man on his feet as ever I saw in a ring. Of course, I don’t know much about Fitzsimmons except from what I have read in the papers, but he’s got to be more than extraordinarily good to beat Hall. I shall back Hall heavily to win the fight.”\n\nIn speaking of a match between Stanton Abbott of England and Champion Jack McAuliffe, the ’Squire said that Abbott would be very foolish to look for a match, as he would not stand a ghost of a show in the ring with McAuliffe, who was cleverer, stronger and a better fighter in every way than the Englishman.\n\nA week ago “Denver” Smith’s limit was $1.50 a day. Now he has an offer of $1,000 a week to “go on the stage.” Corbett’s company offered him $750 a week to spar against the champion.\n\nBilly Murphy of Australia has received an offer from the Crescent Athletic Club of New Orleans to fight Sol Smith of San Francisco. The purse to be hung up was not mentioned, but it is said that a good inducement will be given for the pair. Murphy says that he is satisfied to fight, and has so informed the New Orleans people.\n\nIn the mail that reached the sporting editor's desk this morning was a brown paper communication that would throw Tommy O'Rourke and his chocolate protege into spasms of terror. The heading reads, “A Challenge to George Dickson the featherweight champion.” The writer describes himself as a whirlwind fighter and a cyclone rusher, is the champion amateur of the world and has never known defeat, possibly because he has never been inside a ring. He respectfully recommends himself to the kind offices of Mr. Richard K. Fox, or better still, Mr. Billy Madden.",

Now, according to Joseph Donovan, Allen is not to be denied, and while it may be a trifle cruel, it should be mentioned in order to fully protect those who might be disposed to give Allen's opinion some little weight, knowing as they do he anciently carried prestige himself as a fighter, that, first, Tom Allen was born in Birmingham, and, secondly, so was Charles Mitchell. Tom arrived at the conclusion some years ago from a subtle sort of reasoning, which he has never vouchsafed to make public, that as sure as the sun rises and sets a man born in Birmingham can always lick a man not born in Birmingham. It was figuring along the lines of this ratiocinative process that actuated Tom to back Ed Smith, a Birmingham man against Joe Goddard, when the whole country, \"Denver\" Ed probably included, couldn’t see a ghost of a show ahead. Tom didn’t know anything about Goddard's doing himself wrong beyond the fact at which he could train properly and furthermore he didn’t care. The fact that Smith was originally from Birmingham and Goddard was not was all-sufficient and Tom piled his winning shekels high. Now, as might have been expected, Tom is back with his winning system in regard to the international contest.",

    text: "Tom Allen, the famous retired heavyweight champion, will take in the Corbett-Mitchell fight next month, but the exact date of his departure from this city for Jacksonville will be known to only his most intimate friends. This secrecy Allen thinks necessary to protect him from the authorities of Kentucky, which State he will pass through on his way to Florida. Over a decade ago, he was indicted in Kentucky for his battle with Joe Goss and he has never set a foot on blue grass soil from that day to this. The Kentucky authorities have never made any effort to extradite him from this State, but nevertheless, Tom is afraid they might make trouble for him if his presence in their own bailiwick was known.\n\nThe retired champion is an enthusiastic Mitchell man and is confident Corbett will meet his conqueror in the sturdy Englishman. Allen claims the champion’s battles with Jackson and Sullivan show him to be a very ordinary fighter. “‘Why,’’ said Tom the other day, ‘‘Ed Smith made a ‘bloody sucker’ of the big black Australian when they met in Chicago, and I honestly believe little George Dixon could have finished Sullivan as quickly as Corbett did at New Orleans. In my opinion Mitchell will want nothing better than for the Californian to pursue the same tactics in the coming battle as he did against Sullivan. No matter how shifty he may be, Corbett will learn early in the affair that Mitchell is just as clever when it comes to avoiding wicked punches. Of course both will be prepared to take plenty of punishment and I know that Mitchell can stand the ‘gaff’ as well as the next. I also believe that Corbett’s punches will not compare in force with what he will receive from Charley when they mix matters. Mitchell's forte will be at infighting, and when they come to close quarters the Californian’s stomach will suffer. I shall be astonished if Mitchell does not have everything his own way at short range. When Corbett rushes, providing he indulges in such tactics, I expect to see Mitchell step aside and send in the right, good and hard, straight from the shoulder, on Jim's stomach. It is my belief that Charley will not try to get home above Corbett’s neck, for he can do more damage below that point. I expect to see very little fighting in the first dozen rounds or so, and just who will eventually cut out the work is a hard question to answer. Each man will want some line on the other before he will make any advances.”\n\nAllen says he has secured twelve ox tails from which he will make a jelly that has a tendency, he claims, to harden the stomach. Tom says he will send this preparation to Mitchell’s training quarters, and the Englishman will have the benefit of whatever good qualities it possesses. Allen states that he offered Paddy Smith, ‘Denver’ Smith's brother, $100 for the receipt for this jelly, which all old-time English pugilists revere highly. Very few know how to make it, however."

    text: "Tom Allen was born in Birmingham, England, in April 1840. He stands five feet, nine and one-half inches in height, and weighs at the present time in the neighborhood of 200 pounds. In fighting condition, he tipped the beam at 175 pounds. His first battle was with Waggoner, of Birmingham, $25 (£5) a side, in the autumn of 1861, which Waggoner won. Six months later, he met Young Gould for $100 (£20) a side, and the latter won. Posh Price whipped Allen in fifty-five minutes in July 1862. Allen's next engagement was with Bingley Rose, of Nottingham, England, for $125 (£25) a side, whom he conquered in ten rounds, lasting twenty-nine minutes, January 1864. Some six months later, Bob Smith, the “Liverpool Black,” whipped Allen in two hours and fifteen minutes. He then fought Jack Parkinson, whom he “cut into ribbons” in twenty minutes, for $125 (£25) a side. Meeting Posh Price a second time, for $125 (£25) a side, the two men fought forty-one rounds, lasting two hours and five minutes, in November 1865. Allen had decidedly the best of the fight, and as Price gave a tip to the police and had himself arrested, the stakes were given to Allen.\n\nOn June 12, 1866, Allen defeated George Iles, and on March 5, 1867, fought a draw with Joe Goss for $500 (£100) a side. The fight took place in Monmouthshire, and lasted one hour and fifty-two minutes, in which time thirty-five rounds were fought. Allen afterwards received two forfeits of $250 (£50) each from Bill Thorpe, Peter Millard, and Mike Cocklin.\n\nAllen came to this country in July 1867, and his first fight was with Bill Davis, at Chateau Island, St. Louis, January 12, 1869, when he won in forty-three rounds. On February 23, 1869, he fought Charley Gallagher at Carroll Island, near St. Louis, and was knocked out by the latter in the second round, after fighting but three minutes. On July 15, 1869, he fought Mike McCoole on Foster's Island, in the Mississippi River, for $1,000 (£200) a side, and the excursion money. Nine rounds were fought, and Allen made a chopping-block of his opponent. A crowd broke into the ring, and the referee gave the decision to McCoole. He again met Charley Gallagher, at Foster's Island, near St. Louis, August 17, 1869, and although he had Gallagher whipped in the eleventh round, after twenty-five minutes of sharp fighting, the referee decided in favor of the latter. On May 10, 1870, he fought Jem Mace at Kennerville, near New Orleans, for $3,000 (£1,000) and the championship of the world. Mace won in ten rounds, lasting forty minutes.\n\nOn September 23, 1873, he fought Mike McCoole again, for $2,000 (£400) at Chateau Island, St. Louis, Allen being declared the winner after twenty-nine rounds, lasting twenty minutes, had been fought. He afterwards fought a draw with Ben Hogan, the reformed preacher-pugilist, near Council Bluffs. His last fight was with Joe Goss for the championship of America and $5,000 (£1,000), in Kentucky, in 1876. The men fought in two rings, the first being erected in Kent, and the second in Boone County. Twenty-one rounds were fought in fifty-three minutes, when Goss was declared the winner by a foul. Allen was arrested and put under bonds. He afterwards settled down in St. Louis, where he still lives."

    text: "At a meeting of representative citizens held this evening, a committee headed by Mayor Perkins was appointed to secure the Corbett-Mitchell fight for this city in case it is not allowed to come off in Florida. Mayor Perkins sent a telegram to the pugilists tonight guaranteeing a purse of $25,000 if the fight can be arranged to come off here.\n\nThe fact that the passage of an ordinance regulating licensing authorizing glove contests in Jacksonville did not have the effect of quieting the governor's opposition to the Mitchell-Corbett mill was a disappointment to the patrons of the event, and the later declaration of Governor Mitchell that he will pay no attention to a decision of any circuit judge who may affirm the validity of the Jacksonville ordinance has had a still more depressing effect upon the projectors of the enterprise. Cool-headed people do not agree with the enthusiasts who profess to believe that the fight will come off whether or not.\n\nGovernor Mitchell is as stubborn as a mule. He has started out to prevent Mitchell and Corbett from having a public meeting in Florida, and those who know him best say he will do it, even if he has to take charge of affairs in person. His declaration that he knows as much about the law as any circuit judge in the state is borne out by the facts, as he is a lawyer of eminence, and his assertion that nothing short of the decision of the supreme court will prevent him from taking measures to prevent the fight is regarded by many as tantamount to a declaration that he believes it to be within his power to effectively interfere and that he will do so.\n\nThe two pugilists now at Jacksonville are surrounded by hundreds of admirers. The physical proportions of the champions are the subjects of continued comment, and the points of difference and of advantage are counted over and over and form the theme of endless discussion.\n\nAdmirers of Corbett mention his bouts with great prize fighters when he was yet an amateur. They tell how, when a mere boy, he bested Jack Burke in eight rounds; how he gave Joe Choynski three drubbings; how he outpointed Kilrain with ease, and defeated Dominick McCaffrey, and to cap the climax, whipped Sullivan at New Orleans.\n\nFew venture to predict that Mitchell will outfight Corbett, yet a good many decline to admit that he will lose. By Mitchell's admirers, it is pointed out that when Sullivan was regarded as invincible and before the great Boston man had suffered the effects of inebriety and fast living, which, they say, had rendered him unfit for the ring long before he met Corbett at New Orleans, Mitchell fought him to a standstill at Chantilly. They believe he is a better man now than he was then, and that Corbett is about to find it out to his cost.\n\nAs for the physical development of the men, there is room for disagreement as to which shows to the best advantage. Corbett recently said that he regarded an inch advantage in height as equal to ten pounds advantage in weight. Corbett attributes great importance to advantage in reach, and evidently relies strongly on the fact that he possesses this advantage over the Englishman. In his fight with Sullivan, he jabbed the champion in the face, bread-basket, and short ribs at his pleasure, and got away without receiving a hurtful blow. He expects to serve Mitchell the same way, and his admirers contend that he will have no difficulty in doing so.\n\nTo prove the contrary view, Mitchell's friends point out the numerous victories of Tom Sayers, who weighed only 100 pounds and was of the stocky English build. Short men are experts at infighting, and Mitchell's friends say that unless Corbett converts the meeting into a sprinting match, as they say he did in his battle with Jackson, he will be compelled to fight at close range. They point out the fact that while he struck Sullivan repeatedly, he did not inflict the slightest injury upon him, and they insist that he merely pounded Sullivan until the Boston man swooned from exhaustion. They say that this kind of fighting will suit Mitchell, and as the latter is equally as active and a harder hitter, Tom Allen will be there.\n\nTom Allen of St. Louis says that Corbett jabbed his way to the championship; that in his fight with Sullivan, he never struck a blow that by any means could be decisive of a battle. Others say that Corbett is incapable of delivering a knockout blow unless against a very inferior man or by accident. Mitchell's friends claim Mitchell will not jab Corbett, but will hit him and hit him hard, and that if he gets in on the champion with a crack or two, it will bring Corbett to a standstill, and that in this way Mitchell may get the best of the meeting.\n\nTom Allen will go to Jacksonville to assist in preparing Mitchell for the fight. Tom is a cook of rare accomplishments and a good deal of a doctor. He has had much experience in prize ring affairs and especially in the training of pugilists. He will have charge of the preparation of Mitchell's food and may be one of his seconds in the ring.\n\nGovernor Mitchell today hurled another bomb at the Duval Athletic Club, the promoter of the proposed mill between Corbett and Mitchell. The story goes that the governor is exceedingly wrathy at the course of the Duval county judicial authorities in arresting Corbett and Mitchell. It is said that the governor has been keeping the wires hot all day roasting Solicitor Christie of Duval county, in the matter, charging that Christie and all the other judicial officers of this county are in collusion with the Duval Athletic Club and are abetting the club's efforts to pull off the match and that the arrests and proposed test of the law are not in good faith.\n\nThe governor goes further, it is said, and reiterates that the proposed fight is in violation of the laws of that state and asserts that it shall not come off unless the supreme court decides that such contests are legal. The judicial authorities of this country, who, it is said, the governor has attacked, refuse to either deny or affirm the current reports. They admit that they have received telegrams from the governor in regard to the arrest and the proposed test of the law, but the nature of the dispatches they refuse to divulge. From other sources, however, it is learned that the tenor of the telegrams was such as has been described and that Governor Mitchell is highly indignant at what he terms the “collusion” of the Duval county authorities with the promoters of the fight.\n\nAt any rate, this has been a rather “blue day\" for the sports and there is a rather “shaky” feeling in regard to the pulling off of the fight.\n\nThe situation is about as follows: Gov. Mitchell and Attorney General Lamar, the highest law officers of the state, assert that the contest will violate the laws of the state; Bowden of the Athletic Club and his lawyers say it would not.\n\nGovernor Mitchell was once on the supreme bench, and it is believed that he knows as much about the laws of the state as the attorneys of the club. It is also believed that the opinion of Attorney General Lamar, that the proposed fight would be illegal, was prepared after a consultation with the governor and members of the supreme court.",

    text: "Chances of the Great Battle Occurring in Florida.\n\nCHARLEY MITCHELL TRIES HIS HAND AT ROASTING THE CORBETT CROWD.\n\nThe Britisher Replies to the Stories They Have Been Circulating About Him—A Rabbit-Foot Voodoo Sent Him—Florida's Governor Something of a Sport, Despite His Attitude on the Fight—The Club’s Check to the Stakeholder.\n\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 14.—Everybody here considers that Bowden and his merry men played the trump card, which will win the trick, when they sent the check for the $20,000 purse to John Kelly, and if sports in other parts of the country arrive at the same conclusion within the next few days, the directory of the Duval Athletic Club will be immensely pleased. They now say that the limit as to receipts for admission, upon which the possibilities of a fight hinged until yesterday, has been removed, and that the men will have it out if only two persons pay for tickets. This is a strong statement to be sure since it is not entirely in accordance with all precedent in human nature for men to throw away calmly $25,000 or $30,000, when a few words would, in a measure, save the money. It is not to encourage the sport that the club has taken this stand altogether. It has come to a fight for supremacy between Bowden and his friends and Gov. Mitchell, who is practically single-handed, unless the State troops show more of a disposition to help him out than has yet been manifested.\n\nBowden is a rather bright person at times, but for stubbornness he could give the champion mule “thirty yards in a hundred,” as the saying goes. He is a fighter who, unlike many other kinds of fighters, doesn’t know when he’s whipped.\n\nIT IS BOWDEN VS. MITCHELL.\n\nNow, if the Governor did not happen to be the same sort of a man, the struggle would have been over long ago. When he says a thing he means it, and his friends here say nothing will stop him. So it’s Bowden against Mitchell to a finish, but in this contest the sports do not say, “May the best man win.” They want Bowden to win, and hope that it will not come to a draw of revolvers.\n\nThe mention of Mitchell’s name to Bowden stirs him up as much as the casual suggestion that malaria may be contracted in Florida riles a native. Any person who has ever spoken of quinine in Jacksonville will at once understand how Bowden acts when discussing the Governor’s personality. He handles the Chief Executive without gloves at least once every twenty minutes.\n\nIf the Governor is not between his satanic majesty and the deep blue sea just now, as he appears to be, he may make known today, just how he proposes to knock out Bowden et al. What the ace is which he may lead at the last moment nobody knows, and Bowden, for one, doesn’t care a rap. The strongest part of the whole business is that the Governor himself is just a trifle inclined to be a sport in a modest way. This is no state secret, for just after the Sullivan-Corbett battle his friends had a good chance to jacket him for bad judgment. The story that he lost $200 on the result is said to be absolutely true, therefore, he is not opposed to the fight for the reasons attributed to him by many. Not one of its projectors opposed him politically. The thousands of letters from reform leagues and private citizens which he has received, offering financial aid (but in every case failure to contain anything that might be turned into money) may have had something to do with it, but the consensus of opinion is that Gov. Mitchell said that the fight should not take place here from the start, and couldn’t afford afterward to take water.\n\nCHANCE TO GET EVEN.\n\n“Mitchell is trying to get even on us for the money he lost on Sullivan,” said one of the directors, “Harry Mason will bet him $5,000 that the fight takes place in Florida, which will make him $4,500 winner if he wins.” Pretty strong talk this, but the talk in the club is at times decidedly stronger. There has been no betting to speak of here. Most of the wagers have been at evens that Corbett wins in twenty rounds. “Bat” Masterson and Tom Allen would like to invest $5,000 against this proposition. Edward Kearney of New York, who furnished part of the stake money for Corbett in the Sullivan affair, arrived and was entertained at Mayport. Mr. Kearney is a Corbett enthusiast, and while he knows Mitchell well he doesn’t believe the Englishman can stay very long in a ring with the Californian.\n\n“Charley is plucky,” said the New York merchant, “but Jim's too many for him.”\n\nMITCHELL'S FAITHFUL TRAINING.\n\nST. AUGUSTINE, Fla., Jan. 15.—Charley Mitchell in the presence of the Post-Dispatch's staff correspondent weighed, minus his clothing, 175 pounds this afternoon, and he is in splendid form, though the big reduction in the matter of superfluous tissues has changed his appearance considerably. His brief exposure to the sun on the beach and roads at Anastasia has bronzed him so that he might be mistaken for a sea dog if there was anything about him to fit the sad part. If Messrs. Brady, Corbett, and company could see how conscientiously Mitchell is preparing for the contest, possibly the doubts they entertain and have entertained ever since the match was first talked of would be dispelled. A great deal of what is commonly known as proper “old-fashioned roasting” has been done at both camps, but the Corbett forces have left Charlie and his confreres way back in the woods at this game. As the folks say at Corbett’s place, Mitchell may be only bluffing and perhaps has not even dreamed, even at this late day, of for one moment entertaining a thought of fighting the American, but no man who possesses the intelligence usually distributed among boys of seven will side with Brady and Delaney. After seeing how Mitchell handles himself, Delaney absolutely declines to listen to any arguments to the contrary. He has never believed that Mitchell will fight, and won't be convinced until he is in the ring, and even while the gloves are being adjusted the trainer thinks there is a chance for Charlie to twist his arm out of joint or something of that sort. Delaney still fears that his prediction that Mitchell will poison himself one week from Wednesday night and lay it at the door of one of his attendants.\n\nMITCHELL ANGRY.\n\nWhen Mitchell heard of this his British blood boiled, and if Delaney happened to drop in just about that time there would have been some excitement, even if downright fighting didn’t occur.\n\n“And Corbett wonders why he is unpopular in his own country, does he?” Charlie exclaimed. “Perhaps he thinks that there is no spirit of fair play here. I have seen very little of it, but I wonder what he thinks fair play is? I am quite used by this time to hearing and reading uncomplimentary things about myself, so I don't mind what these idiots say for more than a minute. In his wild desire for advertising Brady talks at times like a paretic, and the others, that is the secret of Corbett’s popularity. It’s not exactly tally with my idea, and should I happen to meet them, the compliments would be interesting. It’s not supposed to be known in my camp what they are doing here. I am not now worried about expenses aside from the club’s allowance and I’ll stay until the time arrives for a fight. I shall be on hand without fail and I hope the burglars will not run off with him before then. Of course, I have trained down from nearly 200 pounds for the purpose of howling around the country as the man who is to fight Corbett. Oh, training is real fun, but how would it do for him to give exhibitions and advertise himself as the man who is to fight Mitchell? Surely my name will draw some money, though not as much as Corbett’s of course, because my name is not as well known.”",

A bloomin’ shark?\"\n\nThe fish was making for the beach and Tom edged back a little. Pretty soon the surf landed the gulping monster and Allen heaved a stone at him. One of the youngsters of the island came along at this juncture and to Tom's horror rushed into the breakers and began tugging at the creature’s tail.\n\n\"Hi, there,\" yelled Allen, \"Look hout a bit, ’es alive, you know.\"\n\n\"It’s a porpoise come ashore to die,\" said the boy. \"Whenever they get sick they put for land. This fellow is dying now.\" The training party was quickly down the beach, and Tom gave them full details of how he had captured the fish.

I should very well like to make you a bet on the weight.\"\n\n\"You can catch me, old chap,\" said the Philadelphian. \"You’re not playing hearts, and I'll have an even thing on the gig.\"\n\nCharley took another look at the porpoise and made another attempt to lift it.\n\n\"It’s a clutch bet that it is over 200 pounds,\" remarked Bat Masterson.\n\nThis decided Mitchell, and he said: \"Well, Doc, I shall have to bet you 20 quid that he’s nearer 200 than 125.\"\n\n\"You’re on,\" said Robbins, and the porpoise was carted to the gymnasium and found to weigh 131 pounds.

    text: "One Tom Allen, and the only one of the sports who left St. Louis for Jacksonville, arrived home this morning over the L. & N.\n\nThere was no brass band to welcome Tom home; no crowd stood at the depot and cheered the corpulent ex-champion pugilist as he alighted from the train; no police formed a cordon about him to escort him to his carriage. Tomasso was alone with his thoughts and his celebrated stomach hardener, ox tail jelly.\n\nHad there been a crowd it is doubtful if Allen would have seen it so engrossed was he with his own sad thoughts. The only person who claimed Allen’s attention was a Post-Dispatch reporter, who boarded the inbound train at the Relay Depot in East St. Louis. It was reported that Alderman Jim Cronin, Brady, Allen, Watkins, et al., would arrive on the morning train, but a search failed to reveal any of the crowd except Allen, and his blue appearance was strongly in contrast with the red sunlight which streamed through the car window. Mr. Allen was not attired in fighting costume; still his apparel was light and easy. There was nothing but his face to indicate that he had picked the loser and staked his reputation as prognosticator of prize fights and lost out. Still his face was enough. When the reporter entered Mr. Allen was down upon all fours, and the first idea was that he was doing penance for his bad judgment. Then seeing that Mr. Allen was running his fingers around the floor of the car the conclusion was drawn that he was searching for the famous stomach hardener which he had prepared for Charley Mitchell, with the intention of throwing it out the car window into the Mississippi with the hope that it would float down the river to the gulf and eventually find its way back to Jacksonville in time for the next victim. After Allen had played horse with himself on the car floor and run his fingers under all the steam pipes and car seats in his vicinity he rose to his feet and looked at the reporter.\n\nIN BLOODY BAD HUMOR.\n\n“Mr. Allen, how did you like the fight?” he was asked.\n\n“Foight! Foight! There was no fight,” was the answer, as Allen searched his pockets with both hands.\n\n“What do you think of Mitchell's showing in the ring?”\n\n“Say, cawn’t you see I've lost me diamond ring and ain't got any tolme to talk.”\n\n“What did Mitchell weigh?”\n\n“How the — do I know what he weighed? I've lost me ring, cawn’t you see, an’ I don’t propose to be interviewed.” And the disgruntled ex-champion searched the cushions of the seats.\n\n“Did Mitchell use the jelly?”\n\nBut Allen didn’t hear. The glitter of a piece of wire from the neck of a beer bottle under an adjoining seat caught his eye and he investigated it, to see if it was the missing ring.\n\n“Where is Cronin?” asked the reporter.\n\n“’E’s in Jacksonville, I guess. ’E couldn’t get a sleeper.”\n\n“Has he got a railroad ticket?”\n\n“Ask 'im when ’e gets home.”\n\nMr. Allen was so thoroughly broken up that all endeavors to extract an interview from him on the subject of the fight showed it would have been cruelty to have pressed the subject any further and he was allowed to continue the search for the ring.\n\nALLEN'S DREAMS.\n\nA party on the train who had come all the way from Jacksonville and occupied a berth near the pugilists, says that Tom had horrible dreams both nights. Once he dreamed that Corbett was begging him for some of the ox tail jelly that he might also have an insulated stomach like Mitchell's when he entered the ring. At another time Allen was dreaming himself and Mitchell were touring the country together, and Mitchell was issuing challenges every night to all comers.\n\nThe same party also overheard a conversation between Cronin and Brady before the train pulled out in which the Alderman threatened to raise the price of franchises 50 percent to get even on the money he lost on Mitchell. The rest of the crowd who were unable to get sleepers will be back by tomorrow morning."

The veteran enjoyed his trip to the land where oranges grow, but says the great fight was a \"bloody\" farce.\n\n\"Mitchell was outclassed in every respect, and Corbett would have chopped him into ribbons in a few more rounds,\" said Tom to a Post-Dispatch representative last night. \"The Californian has improved fully a thousand per cent since he defeated Sullivan, while Charley is not anywhere near the man he was a few years ago. Of course, I must confess that I fancied Mitchell, but after seeing and comparing the pair before the fight I concluded not to bet a cent on him. While he never said so, I am confident Charley knew all along that he was up against a hard game. Although game as a pebble, I don’t think he would have made much of a row if his namesake, Gov. Mitchell, had succeeded in preventing the fight.\n\n\"I was given to understand that Corbett trained for the affair as he pleased. It was said his punches lacked steam and amounted to but little. Well, this might be true, but excuse me from coming in contact with any of them. If his appearance after the fight can be taken for a criterion, I don’t think Mitchell wants to stop any more of them.\n\n\"Yes sir, I am thoroughly convinced this Californian can whip them all, including Peter Jackson and Ed Smith. The latter told me after the fight that he was really anxious to meet Corbett, but my advice to him is stay away. The champion has more confidence in himself now than he ever had before, and I expect to see him polish off Jackson next June handily. Mitchell's cunning did not count. Corbett simply made a hurricane fight and Charley was unable to keep out of his way. Whether Jackson will be able to do so remains to be seen. My idea is that he won't, and the Californian will soon have the referee counting the ten-second limit when they come together. Bat Masterson was greatly disappointed over the result and informed me he was ashamed to return home to Denver,\" continued Allen. \"Bat declared right along that Corbett was a cur, but I have an idea he has changed his mind since Thursday. The Corbett-Sullivan and Corbett-Mitchell fights can hardly be compared. Sullivan cut out the work at New Orleans and Corbett took his time finishing, and I thought it was rather, in fact altogether, too long. Thursday, however, he set sail for Mitchell in the second round and, blamed me, but what a bloomin’ monkey he did make him look like! If he had fought the same way at New Orleans, Sullivan would never have lasted anywhere near as long as he did.\"\n\nAllen says his famous ox-tail jelly hardened up Mitchell’s stomach all right, but Corbett insisted upon punching him in the face and the true merit of the jelly was not in this fight developed."

Notwithstanding the enormous purses hung up in this country in the past few years for glove contests, only two of the big fighters before the public, James J. Corbett, the champion, and Charley Mitchell, are rated as men of means. Corbett is supposed to be worth in the neighborhood of $75,000, most of which is invested in New York City real estate. Should he defeat Peter Jackson next June, the champion’s money-making capacities will be unlimited for years to come, and he may eventually be rated among the list of American millionaires. The big Californian sticks like muellage to money.\n\nCharley Mitchell is credited with being worth $100,000. Mitchell is a son-in-law of George Washington Moore, better known as \"Pony\" Moore, and was interested with the old American minstrel in his London music hall ventures. Moore sold this business to a syndicate a short time ago, and over in England they say \"Pony\" is worth close on to $1,000,000.\n\nJohn Lawrence Sullivan, the man from Boston, who lorded over the ring for ten years, is credited with having earned $500,000 or more since he defeated Paddy Ryan. John has always been generous to a fault, however, and today he has nothing to show for this enormous sum but an ordinary dwelling-house in Boston, which he presented to his sister several years ago. The famous ex-champion calls this his home, and declares he will spend his declining years beneath its roof.\n\nTom Allen, retired world’s champion, now a resident of St. Louis, has nothing to show for his long and successful ring career but a saloon on Market street, the profits of which enable him to eke out a comfortable existence in his old days.\n\nMike McCool, Allen’s old rival in this city back in the early seventies, died in a New Orleans home for paupers.\n\nJem Mace, who defeated Allen for the world’s championship, is a race track follower in England. The old timers maintain that Mace was the greatest fighter the world has ever seen.\n\nPeter Jackson, black champion of England and Australia, was in the saloon business in San Francisco when \"Parson\" Davies induced him to go on the stage and impersonate Uncle Tom. His show has always done well, and Peter is now thought to have a few thousand dollars.\n\nJoe Goddard, the big Australian, who was defeated by \"Denver\" Ed Smith, is said to have been a successful contractor before he entered the prize ring. His conqueror, Smith, is now a Denver saloonkeeper.\n\nJake Kilrain also runs a saloon in Baltimore, and Frank Slavin operates an inn or roadhouse near London.\n\nBob Fitzsimmons, the middleweight champion, is said to be \"broke,\" and the lightweight champion, Jack McAuliffe, is very nearly always in the same shape financially. McAuliffe is a well-known character on the race tracks around New York and has won and lost thousands on the turf.\n\nJack Dempsey was the middleweight champion of the world for years, but never saved anything and is now a poor man.\n\nThe world’s featherweight champion, George Dixon, colored, is married and owns his own home near Boston.\n\nBilly Myer, the Streator lightweight, has an interest in a Chicago saloon.\n\nJim Hall has been living off his salary as Charley Mitchell's sparring partner since his defeat at the hands of Fitzsimmons.\n\nDan Creedon draws a salary for the same work from Jim Corbett."

    text: "John Carroll of 1626 North Broadway called at the Fourth District Police Station, at Tenth and North Market streets, this morning and positively identified a suspect, who calls himself John Foley, as one of the three men who entered his saloon last night and robbed him and his friends of $192 and two gold watches in true Western style. To Michael McGill, alias \"Midget,\" a young man who witnessed the bold hold-up and who called at the station this morning with Carroll, is due Foley's capture.\n\nMcGill was sitting behind the stove in Carroll & Harrington’s saloon, on the southeast corner of Broadway and Mound street, last night when the three daring thieves entered, and so had a good opportunity to see them without being seen. As soon as they had departed with their booty he stepped out the back way and around to the Fourth District Station and told the Sergeant in charge that he thought he could identify one of the robbers as he had seen him hanging about Tom Allen’s saloon on Market street. Sergts. Wilson and McFarland were detailed to accompany the boy and going to Tom Allen’s, \"Midget\" pointed out Foley as soon as they entered the door. The officers arrested him and took him back to the station, but he stoutly denied his guilt. He claimed that he did not have a cent of money about him, but on being searched the police found a $10 bill and a $5 bill in his inside pocket. This made them suspect they had the right man, and when Carroll identified him this morning they were more certain of the fact. Early this morning Capt. Klely set special officers Cavan and Sullivan to work on the case and they with some of Chief Desmond’s men, the Captain thinks, will have little difficulty in locating the other two robbers by finding out who Foley is and who his associates are. Capt. Kelly does not believe the prisoner’s real name is Foley. \"Foley\" says he is a stranger in the city, having only arrived here three days ago from Wisconsin. He is a young man, apparently about 20, has short hair and a smooth face, which this morning wore an expression of supreme disgust. When seen he surlily refused to discuss his case, except to say that he \"never was in the saloon at all.\"\n\nThe robbery occurred at 9:20 o’clock last evening and was a most audacious hold-up. Dennis Spillane, Jerry McMahon and the son of a neighboring shoemaker, were playing cards at a table in the rear of the saloon with John Carroll, one of the proprietors, who was on watch. James Minogue sat near the table reading the Post-Dispatch and Pete McGovern and Michael McGill were seated behind the stove, contentedly smoking their pipes. The rest of the story was related by Minogue to a Post-Dispatch reporter this morning thus: \"When I heard the front door open just before 9:30, I laid down my paper and was astonished to see a man enter with a pistol in his hand. He walked straight back to where we were sitting and pointing his weapon at Carroll, ordered the crowd to throw up their hands. At first I thought the fellow was joking, but when I saw two other fellows came in behind him I thought he must be an officer of the law making a gambling raid. He yelled again, ‘Throw up your hands!’ and the two men behind him rushed out and grabbed the card players. The little fellow who had a dark hat and a sack coat held Spillane and McMahon, who had thrown up their hands while the big fellow who had a white handkerchief tied over his mouth and nose went after Carroll. He was a powerful, big man, but Carroll tussled with him. The man with the gun, and who had a mustache and wore an overcoat and a cap, angrily said, ‘Get out of the way till I shoot; he’s the fellow I'm after,’ referring to Carroll by a vile name. The big man threw Carroll over against the back door and the saloon-keeper threw up his hands. He with Spillane and McMahon, who had thrown up their hands, were held at bay by the man with the gun while the little fellow went through his two men and got a watch from each and the big fellow got into Carroll’s pocket and got $175. Then he went behind the counter and robbed the till of some $17, but failed to see a watch which was lying on the shelf. Having secured all the booty they were after, they fled through the front door, the man with the weapon keeping his pistol leveled all the time at the card players. As he went out the door he remarked, ‘If you follow me out of here, I'll blow your brains out.’ With this the two disappeared.

To my mind, Bowen was clearly out then. He might not have showed outward evidence of the terrific punishment administered to him, but his vitality was exhausted. In these glove contests, a man may be all but out, and still show little evidence of the fact, except to an experienced eye. When a pugilist reaches this stage, there is no use in prolonging the battle, and his seconds should surrender for him. Had Bowen been fortunate enough to have a man behind him who understood his business, I believe he would be still in the land of the living. When Bowen went down, he was no doubt completely exhausted. Fresh air might have relieved him, but it could not be gotten in one of those enclosed fighting arenas. Thousands of spectators are packed inside, smoking and chewing, and the atmosphere on a warm night is polluted like sewer water. Inhaling such poison in his lungs is anything but beneficial to an unconscious man, especially after he has received a drubbing like Bowen got from Lavigne. I am a firm believer in fighting in the open air, and if Bowen's death puts a quietus on legalized glove contests, the old-time methods will come into vogue once more. Bowen's death may affect the sport for the time being, but if it does, it will be only a temporary setback. This talk about pugilism being dead because the Louisiana authorities are expected to legislate against it is all rot. Fighting flourished before the New Orleans clubs were ever heard of, and it will continue to do so after they have gone out of existence.",

    text: "Tom Allen, the retired champion pugilist of the world, has decided views on modern pugilism and the new school of fighters. The veteran frequently refers to them as bad actors and bum pugs. \n\nI regard it as a duty to enlighten the young and likewise the old about the prize ring. There are a lot of the younger generation who do not know what a prize fighter is. They have never seen anything but glove fighters in these days. A prize fighter is a fighter who battles with bare knuckles in the open air and on the turf, regardless of hail, rain, sunshine, or snow. A boxing champion, or glove-fighter, is one who has feather pillows on his hands when he enters the ring, which must be in a warm, comfortable room. In my time we had prize fights; now there are boxing matches with top-heavy purses hung up.\n\nIt has been said that I am not the retired champion pugilist. After my fight with Joe Goss in 1876, I went to Chicago to box a week at one of the theaters. Mike McDonald told me that Jem Mace, who was also in Chicago, was going to answer my challenge. I told Mike I would fight Mace for $10 or as much more as Jem could raise. I knew Mace was broke, and I did not want to bluff him by naming a figure he could not get. I wanted to have another go at him. The upshot of it was that Mace and I traveled together all over the country. I was billed and acknowledged as the champion of the world, and Mace as the ex-champion. I am the only pugilist who ever left this country open to fight any man living. On my arrival in England, I beat all the best men of that country and retired. I was then 39 years of age and had been in the ring nineteen years. I have fought more battles than Jem Mace, Joe Coburn, John C. Heenan, and John Morrissey all put together.\n\nThe dirtiest deal I ever got, and I have had some pretty hard ones, was in my fight with Joe Goss. After I had been robbed out of the fight and I got back to Cincinnati, Johnny Dyer, one of Goss’ seconds, said he would fight me for $1,000. He was just what I wanted, as he had done me a great lot of dirt when I was fighting Goss. We put up a $250 forfeit to fight in four weeks, but he forfeited. That was the last I heard of him until I was across the water. Then I saw he was challenging any man in America. I was, mind you, in England. Dave Kendal, Eph. Holland, the referee, Black Edwards, a Cincinnati newspaper man, and Red Leary got about $10,000 out of my fight with Goss, which I was swindled out of on a claim of foul. That was the first fight this man “Macon,” as J. B. McCormack calls himself, ever saw. He was on the Enquirer then. The reason I mention his name is that he is giving his opinions in the papers about the prize ring of thirty years ago and comparing the fighters of that time with the bum boxers of today. There is John L. Sullivan, “Macon's” idol, and the greatest man he ever saw fight. Let's see what his opinion and John L. Sullivan amount to. Billy Madden, an old beer-slinger of mine, took Jack Sullivan to New York and matched him against a big dock-walloper named Flood. They boxed on a barge, and Sullivan won. He next beat Jimmy Elliott, a blind man, that Charley Gallagher beat in two rounds in 1868, when all the crooks from New York broke into the ring. Jim Corbett, of Philadelphia, the partner of Dan Noble, who is now doing twenty years in England, was referee.\n\nPaddy Ryan called himself champion of America by beating Joe Goss, who was never champion of anywhere, because Johnny Dyer forfeited $250 to me at Cincinnati three days after my fight with Goss. Dyer and Elliott fought for the championship of America. So I don’t see any man that Sullivan ever met that was a champion. Charles Mitchell was never champion of England and never fought for that title, but he had so much to say that you would think he was Shan of Jupiter and this earth was too small to think about.\n\nThen there was Tug Wilson, a man old enough to be Sullivan's father, and a 140-pound man. The next man is Alf Greenfield. He boxed Sullivan four rounds in Boston. The papers said he could have knocked Sullivan out, but he was afraid to do so. This man Greenfield was working on a canal near Birmingham, England, when I took him in hand. I showed him how to box, but I could not learn him how to fight. I got Greenfield to fight at Lord Lonsdale’s estate. Tug Wilson was the other fellow. The Prince of Wales and the gentlemen who saw them with the bare knuckles were disgusted. Greenfield and Wilson are both in Sullivan's terrible record. Everybody from St. Paul to San Francisco has beat the Maori and Patsey Cardiff.\n\nThen comes the biggest farce I ever saw in my thirty-four years’ experience in the prize ring. Sullivan and Kilrain pulled and tugged at each other for over seventy rounds. Sullivan stood in the middle of the ring in the fiftieth round, heavy and not able to move a foot. Kilrain asked him to make a draw and would not go at him. No one could call that fighting. Then Kilrain fell down, and this “greatest of pugilists” deliberately jumped on him, not only once, but twice. It was foul, but Sullivan could not have lost if he had kicked Kilrain’s head off. Prof. Mike Donovan can prove this. “Macon” calls this record a world-beater. Then John turned actor and went to Australia. Joe Goddard followed him and challenged him in every town he showed in. He got back to this country on the bum and borrowed money to bring him and his actors back. After three years of froin, he agreed to box Corbett. As he would not box for less than $10,000 a side, he thought no man could raise that amount. What Corbett had to do was just to walk 'round while Sullivan stood like “Ajax defying the lightning” for twenty rounds and never touched Corbett once. In the last round, Corbett just let go his left and right, and down went “Ajax.”\n\nAfter this, “Macon” McCormack shook the “world-beater” J. L., and took Corbett on his staff. I, for myself, think that Jim Corbett is without doubt the greatest boxer of the day, but the way he acts doesn’t show that he is very willing to take the gaff, or he would have taken on Fitzsimmons and boxed in three months for $35,000. I think he could have won, and very easily at that; but as for Corbett saying that the men 25 years ago were not as clever as they are today, I beg to differ with him.\n\nBoxing and prize fighting are two different trades. A man to be a prize fighter must learn to strike straight. He cannot stop a blow with his arms, like a man can with boxing gloves on. Men fighting with bare knuckles do not go so close to each other as men that have gloves on, for the simple reason that a man can reach three inches longer. So that you can put on your gloves and draw a blow or save yourself until the referee comes and parts the boxers.\n\nAll boxers I have seen stand with their feet so wide apart that they could not cover themselves if they were on the turf, and they could not strike a blow at all if they had only their bare hands. In boxing, you can swing your arms in any way you think you can catch your opponent. There are a lot of cranks that think Fitzsimmons has got a favorite wrist blow. Just imagine what jays they must be. A man should not wonder at such fellows getting knocked out in one round and a half if he tells such tales. Fitzsimmons is going over to England for the championship. That is what I have seen Fitzsimmons fight and he won both fights with his favorite right hand. The first fight I saw was with Peter Maher.",

    text: "Two wise old prize fighters, who learned all that they know about fighters and fighting right in the ring, have looked Jim Corbett over carefully, and declare him fit to step into the ring to-morrow and fight for the championship of the world against all comers. The decision was not arrived at offhand, nor was it given at the request or solicitation of Jim Corbett.\n\nThe two fighters whose verdict was obtained are Tom Allen, who was for years the heavyweight champion of the world, and Tom Kelly, whose fame as a middleweight was almost as great as that of Tom Allen. They are both old men now, hale and hearty, but long past active work in the ring. They both are running prosperous saloons on Market street, between Sixth and Seventh streets, Allen having in addition a concert hall, over which he himself presides every night.\n\nAt the request of the Post-Dispatch the old champions consented to inspect Corbett and give their candid, unbiased opinions of him. They had seen him at other times—on the stage, in the ring and at private exhibitions. Allen had seen him whip Kilrain, Mitchell and finally Sullivan. Kelly was master of ceremonies at a private exhibition Corbett gave two or three years ago at the Exposition Music Hall. They, therefore, know the man well, and are able to make a fair comparison between his condition now and at that time.\n\nThe “pugs” occupied the upper left hand box at the matinee at Havlin’s Theater Thursday afternoon, and showed a most intense interest in Corbett and his play. Whenever Corbett appeared they smiled like boys with a new toy. It was clear that the young champion was making a most favorable impression on the two old ones.\n\nWhen he first stepped on the stage Kelly said to Allen:\n\n“Tom, doesn’t he look a bit light?\"\n\n“Hit’s the bloomin’ military jacket he has as does it,” said Allen, and they became silent again, watching the show with renewed interest.\n\nAt the opening of the third act Corbett does a boxing turn with McVey. He is dressed in the customary tights and a flesh-colored shirt, with the sleeves entirely cut out. He shows up much bigger stripped than he does in his clothes. Every movement he made was closely watched by the two old veterans, who were anxious to find any defects if there were any existing. Every blow he struck McVey was watched as if something important depended upon it.\n\nBoth men were convinced that Corbett is a better man to-day than he ever was, and that all stories about his being out of condition were unfounded. They both furnished the Post-Dispatch with statements of their opinions as to Corbett’s condition.\n\nTom Allen's Statement:\n\nI think Corbett is ready to go into the ring to-day and fight a better fight than any he has ever fought. He is the fastest and quickest big man I ever saw in my life, bar none.\n\nOne reason why I know Corbett is in good condition is his neck. Look at the back of a man’s neck if you want to see if he is going off. If it is hollow and stringy get away from him, because he is done for. If it is round and full and solid, like Corbett's is he is all right.\n\nConsidering everything that Corbett does in the theater he is in splendid shape. He is firm and solid and his eye is perfect. I don’t like the side licks he makes in his show boxing, nor do I like his double licks he hits McVey, but he only does that to show how he can fool with a good man and get away.\n\nI saw him fight Mitchell and I saw him fight Sullivan, and I think he is a better man to-day than he was then. I lost money on him in the Sullivan fight, because I misjudged him, thinking him too light and spare. He is the most deceiving man in that way that ever stepped in the ring. He doesn't measure about the chest by eight inches what I did when I fought at 145 pounds, but he is a taller man than I was then.\n\nFitzsimmons is lucky. He would not have whipped Maher if Maher had not been blind. He will no more whip Corbett than a 2:40 horse could beat Gentry. It is about like putting a 2:40 horse against Gentry. Corbett is way too fast and there is nothing in boxing Corbett doesn't know. Fitzsimmons has only one hand. The only thing I am afraid of is that champagne they say Corbett drinks. I don't know if he does, but it is terrible stuff for any man to use. A bit of ale or beer would be better for him.\n\nTOM ALLEN.\n\nTom Kelly's Statement:\n\nI must say to begin with that I have been a Corbett man all along. When my friend Allen lost money on Sullivan, I won some on Corbett. My faith in the lad started after his Kilrain fight and I believe in him yet. People ask me every day what I think of the fight. I always tell them Corbett will win, and I will always think so until some man I have not heard of yet turns up and whips him.\n\nHe looks to me a bit lighter than he was when I last saw him, but he seems to be in splendid shape. He is a young fellow and ought to be in good condition, seeing how much he has at stake and what good sense he has always shown in his business. His eye looks bright, and when he boxes he jumps around as though he knew what he was doing.\n\nI think he is better to-day than he ever was, and that he will whip Fitzsimmons when they meet. Not without a fight, however, because Fitzsimmons is tricky, but he will whip him.\n\nYou notice when Corbett boxes with anybody that he wastes no work in false leads and feints. He is always ready, but never too eager. Corbett will never hit out at a man who merely feints at him. His eye is too good and sure for that, and then he has confidence in himself. That is another great help to any fighter, even if he is a poor one, which Corbett is not.\n\nThen Corbett is so much faster than Fitzsimmons ever was that he will have no trouble getting away from him. Fitzsimmons can only fight one way, and that is close in. He will never get near Corbett—that is never near enough to do his kind of fighting. Fitzsimmons has a man about his own size and weight now to tackle and Corbett is the lad to lick him.\n\nTOM KELLY.\n\nThe day that the two old fighters saw Corbett had been a busy one for the champion. At 10 o'clock in the morning he was at the Pastime Gymnasium playing handball as hard as he could play. He stayed there until after noon and then hurried downtown for lunch and a short rest.\n\nAt 2 o'clock he was ready to go on in the matinee performance at Havlin's where he is seldom off the stage during the two hours and a half the play lasts. Back to his hotel and then again to the theater for another performance concluded his day's programme. He will give up the playing business and go into regular training.",

As he started to enter his own place, he was not pleased with the quietude which pervaded it. There were few customers and none of them had been spending much money. Allen's heart was filled with bitterness.\n\nAcross the street, at the Ohio saloon, it was different. The place was wide open and sounds of revelry could be heard for blocks. It was gall and wormwood to the ex-champion, who felt that his friends had deserted him.\n\nHe stood on the pavement in front of his own place and, shaking his fist at his rival's resort, indulged in a loud soliloquy that was more forcible than classical.\n\nHis heart was filled with bitterness and he recalled the times when his own dance hall was the abiding place of the “dead game sports” who spent their money as free as water. But now a change had come. In those days, the populace had been proud to come to his place and they esteemed it a privilege for him to take their money in exchange for the good cheer he offered them.\n\nHe could not see how it was that the crowds would desert him to patronize a place like the one across the way. Allen talked about how square he had always run his place, and how he had kept within the law. He had made the block the headquarters, and now this German had persuaded them to go and spend their time and shekels with him.\n\nIn a spirit of bitterness, Allen drew his revolver and began to shoot.\n\nPatrolman Maher had heard Allen's soliloquy, and though he did not see the shots begin whizzing, he was there to arrest Allen. Allen was locked up at the station. Although he had $5 in his pockets, he was content to remain in his comfortable quarters.\n\nWhen his case was called at 10 o'clock, he was loath to leave his comfortable quarters. His case was continued until April.",

He left orders that he was tired and did not want to be disturbed until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and Allen's barkeeper wouldn't wake him when a Post-Dispatch reporter called.\n\n“Denver Ed” is said to be looking well and to be anxious for a fight. While here he will talk business with Allen, and the latter will back him if he can get a scrap on with any of the big fellows. Smith expects to remain here for a week or ten days, and to go then to Hot Springs for a month.\n\nPat Smith, “Denver Ed's” less famous brother, preceded him by several days, and came over from Chicago, also putting up at Tom Allen's. He leaves shortly for California at the instance of Martin Murphy, who writes him that he has succeeded in getting on a match for him with “Young Corbett.”\n\nWhen “Denver Ed” returns from Hot Springs he will do his training here if he succeeds in getting a fight on.\n\nIke Weir of Boston, the celebrated “Belfast Spider,” is here to get a fight with Daly of St. Louis. In his younger days Ike Weir was the swiftest featherweight in America and time and time again whipped all the good men in his class.\n\nAs the Spider grew older he grew taller and his weight increased. Weight put him out of his class and out of the championship ranks of the pugilists. He now weighs about 140 pounds, but thinks he is fast enough for Daly. The Spider won't need much training, and of Daly he says: “I can whip him in a minute.”\n\nThe Spider is also staying at Tom Allen's place, and there will be nothing but prize fight talk there for some days. The talk is likely to result in at least a go between Weir and Daly."

    text: "Exciting amateur contests are expected in the field games at the Hibernian picnic at the Fair Grounds next Sunday. The best of the local athletes have entered for the various events and the fields will be large.\n\nIn the athletic events, the smallest field will be composed of ten, and fourteen is the least number in any of the bicycle races except the event for lady riders, in which there will be five starters. This will be at a mile, and among the starters will be Miss Mollie La Tour, considered the best lady rider in St. Louis, and Miss Tottie Shaw, her most dangerous rival. The other three ladies do not expect to be able to finish in front of them.\n\nA special feature will be a foot race between teams of six each from the schools of St. Bridget, St. Malachy, and St. Lawrence O'Toole. The six best sprinters from each school will compete in a 220-yards dash for gold medals. Some of the cracks who will compete in the runs are J. Lewis, Holland, Walsh, Withers, Bland, and Gibbons of the Christian Brothers’ College and Dillon, the champion of Washington University, who took off the honors at the recent Washington University field day. He is a former St. Louis University and Georgetown College man and is in the Washington Law School.\n\nThe entries closed last Saturday, and at least twenty-five were refused because they were received too late. Entries for the horse races may be made up to the last hour. The handicapping in the games will be done by the A. A. U. and the A. O. H. official handicappers.\n\n“I never was much of a hand at fighting in the newspapers, but I will fight any man in the world, bar none.”\n\nThis is the declaration made by “Denver Ed” Smith, one of the top-notchers among pugilists, whom Tom Allen and many people believe can eat up and spit out Sharkey or Maher or whip either Corbett or Fitzsimmons, Goddard, or any of the other upper lights of the heavyweight class. Smith is a big, stout fellow, with all his front teeth missing as a memento of one of his fights. He doesn’t look much out of condition and would probably find it easy to get down to fighting trim.\n\nWhatever his ring tactics may be, he is a pugilist of the Tom Allen, John L. and old-time school when it comes to his conversation, and he doesn’t use the limpid English of “Gentleman Jim.”\n\nHe refers to other prize fighters as “guys,” “stiffs,” “blokes” and “dead uns,” and his sentences would have to be quarantined and disinfected before they would pass in public society. Smith came from Pittsburg, and in a week he will go to California via Hot Springs, accompanied by his brother, Pattie, a lightweight pugilist, who also aims high.\n\n“I am matched to fight Jeffreys, who trained Corbett for his Fitzsimmons fight. It will take place in October before the Olympic Club of San Francisco for a purse of $3,000. I'll fight any man in the world for all of the purse, and my brother Pattie will fight any lightweight in the world bar Kid Lavigne. He has good backing and will be staked for any amount by Bill Stekle of Chicago and Dominick O'Malley of New Orleans. He has been sick, but he is better now than he ever was.\n\n“I have had two big fights lately and did not lose either time on merits.\n\n“In California, I fought Choynski and ought to have won easy. The referee gave us the same instructions that Corbett and Fitzsimmons had—that we could hit in clinches and break-aways with one hand free. I did it and rapped Choynski two or three times in breaks, and the crowd hollered ‘holy murder,’ and, I believe, would have broken into the ropes at me. Then Choynski used his head and butted me twice. Then I went to fighting in his fashion and rammed my nut into his wind. You never heard such a squeal as went up from the crowd. They yelled foul so many times and so loud that the referee gave the decision against me. I should have won.\n\n“My defeat by Goddard was also unexpected. I whipped him in New Orleans in eighteen rounds, before the Olympic Club, when Tom Allen handled me, and I thought him so easy that I took a long trip to South Africa to get on a match with him. If Allen had been handling me I would have won. As it was, I was careless in training, somewhat reckless, and just before the fight got a touch of the weakening African fever. I lost the fight to him in four rounds. He is a tremendous big fellow, stands 6 feet 2 inches in the ring and weighs, as he walks around, 220 pounds.\n\n“I am after a fight with Sharkey and we might be able to get a good purse in the West. After his recent break with Maher he would have trouble in getting a purse in the East. I am not out after Maher, for we belong to what might be called the same stable. Fitz is a better man than Corbett. I don't think Fitz will ever fight again, unless he meets Goddard for the world’s championship. The fighters are all glad that Corbett was put out. That stiff was a hog and would never give another man a chance. He was after the almighty dollar all the time, and made it easier than any other pugilist ever did. By whipping Sullivan, when any other man could have done it, he got up. He stayed up by whipping Mitchell, who was then the worst kind of a has-been. When he first met a real good man he got whipped.\n\n“In all my fights I have never found any soft spots and have always had to fight uphill. George La Blanche the Marine was the lightest man I ever met in the ring, and he was six pounds heavier than I.\n\n“I have backing and am ready to meet any man in the world.”",
    summary: "The article covers the Hibernian Games featuring notable athletes like Dillon and Lewis Holland, alongside \"Denver Ed\" Smith's challenge to heavyweight boxers, embodying 19th-century sports culture."

    text: "John L. Sullivan will run as an independent candidate for Mayor of Boston this fall with the added intention, if not himself elected, of defeating Mayor Josiah Quincy, who will be the regular Democratic candidate for re-election.\n\nWhen Mayor Quincy refused to shake hands with John L. Sullivan, a native of Boston, at Oarsman Ten Eyck's reception to Faneuil Hall, he committed what may prove to be a fatal political mistake. Sullivan was dumfounded. According to one of the Mayor's official organs, the big fighter was easily the idol of the occasion. The crowd chased and cheered him. Ten Eyck was almost ignored at times.\n\nSullivan's amazement at the slight put upon him by Mayor Quincy gradually changed to anger, and this anger has become vindictiveness.\n\nAt first, after thinking the matter over, he was inclined to content himself with supporting an anti-octopus nominee like Mr. Wardner or Judge Slanker. Now he has crossed the Rubicon and put his foot through the bridge timbers.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan will now ask the support of his fellow citizens at the polls. At one time he could have gone to Congress, but he declined. Then his professional duties were in the way. Now he feels that he can spare the time to serve his townsmen.\n\nThere is nothing unprecedented about Sullivan announcing himself a candidate for Mayor of even so staid and steady a town as Boston.\n\nThe prize ring has brought better men than Sullivan to the front in politics.\n\nThe Sullivan-Kilrain fight—which took place at Richburg, Miss., eight years ago—brought to the front the best Mayor New Orleans has ever had.\n\nWho that was there will ever forget that fearful day in July?\n\nThe trip to the battleground was an all-night one, and St. Louis was well represented in the big crowd which made the journey.\n\nTom Allen and Tom Kelly were there, and so were Fred Watkins and Jake Esher, who are now fighting their battles in another land. Abe Slupsky was there, too, with Dan, Charley, and John Daly. So, too, was Bob Farrell. Those of the St. Louis group who are still in the land of the living will recall the one startling incident before the fight. Its managers had charged $10 for tickets to Richburg and when the crowd reached there it was announced that another charge of $5 would be made for seats around the ring.\n\n“Don’t pay it,” shouted a brawny, broad-shouldered man, as the crowd from the train surrounded the ring only to be confronted with the demand for the extra $5. “Don't pay it. Be men. Stand out against this highway robbery. They have already charged $10 for a ride in a cattle car. Now they propose to hold us up for another $5. Follow me men. Let us take charge here.”\n\nAll that crowd needed was a leader.\n\nThe strange man led and the mob followed. There were none there so bold as to dare to bar the way of that army. When it was seated and quiet and order restored there were cries for a referee, but no one dared accept the place.\n\nThe men suggested for the position by Sullivan's friends were not to the Kilrain men’s liking. It looked as though there would be no fight owing to the absence of a referee, when Tom Kelly of St. Louis shouted: “There's a man there that would make a good referee. What's the matter with him?\"\n\nAll hands looked at the individual whom Kelly had singled out of the motley gathering. They recognized him as the brawny fellow of the few moments before who had led them into the ring and helped them hold possession of it. Like Kelly, too, they recognized him as the man for the place, and from one end of the ring to the other the welkin rang with cries of “Yes, yes, he’s the man; he'll do.”\n\nThe brawny fellow was cornered. He stood his ground for a moment, begged in a manly way to be excused, and then, as the mob thundered its demand, he capitulated and took up his place in the roped arena.\n\nThe fight was for the championship of all the world. A king's ransom depended on the issue. But here to decide the great points of the contest was chosen a man unknown to those who had the great battle in charge and unknown to the vast army of sports who had come from all corners of the world to see it.\n\nBut the unknown proved the best in all the wide world for the place. Only once was one of his decisions questioned. That was when Pony Moore, one of Kilrain's backers, said: “He has money on the fight.”\n\nThen there was a pause in the proceedings. The referee stopped the fight just long enough to look Moore in the face and to say, “Take that back!\"\n\nMoore took it back, and so quickly that the crowd around the ringside scarcely noticed the interruption.\n\nThe man who refereed that fight by his single bold act leaped from obscurity into national notoriety. He gained for himself in a single hour the reputation of being a man of nerve and good judgment and that in the south means everything.\n\nThat notoriety made John Fitzpatrick the best-known man in New Orleans and a year after the Sullivan-Kilrain fight had taken place this same John Fitzpatrick was elected Mayor of the Crescent City.\n\nIt has often been said since that he was the best Mayor New Orleans has ever had.\n\nJohn Morrissey of Troy, N. Y., the man who beat Heenan and who fought Sullivan that historic battle in the long ago had a seat in Congress once and held it down honorably and well. The old English champion, John Gully, was a member of the British Parliament in the latter days of his life, and there are others beside he and Morrissey and Fitzpatrick who were graduated from the prize ring into the political arena. Why with such precedent therefore, hasn't the only Sully, the man whom James Boyle O'Reilly, the Boston poet, immortalized as the apotheosis of the pugilist, the right to aspire to the highest office within the gift of the people of Boston? And if not, why not?",
    summary: "John L. Sullivan, a legendary boxer, announced his candidacy for Boston mayor after a public snub from incumbent Josiah Quincy, echoing political moves by past fighters like Tom Allen."

He was locked up at the Chestnut Street Police station. The causes leading to the shooting are not clear.\n\nTom Allen is one of the most noted sporting characters in the country. He was the champion pugilist of England before he came to America many years ago and for a long time afterward held the mortal championship. After he retired from the ring, he located in St. Louis and became proprietor of the \"Champions’ Rest,\" a saloon and dance hall on Market Street.\n\nTim Confoy, who will probably die from the result of his wounds, is 30 years old and is a stage hand at Havlin's Theater.

    text: "Old Ex-Pugilist Claims He Shot in Self-Defense.\n\nTom Allen doesn't seem to be worrying over the death of Timothy Confoy, who was shot by Allen in the retired pugilist's drinking resort, \"Champions' Rest,\" on Market Street, early Thursday morning.\n\nConfoy died late Sunday night on the operating table in the City Hospital. He declared in almost his last breath that he had caused no difficulty in Allen's place, and that he knew of no reason why Allen should have fired upon him. Allen will give no further explanation of his act than to say he shot Confoy when he saw Confoy make a movement as if to draw a pistol. He says that when the proper time comes he will tell his full story.\n\nAllen, who is a prisoner in the Four Courts holdover, passed Sunday afternoon calmly reading the newspapers, and Sunday night, after being told that his victim was dead, he expressed mild regret that the shots proved fatal and then went to sleep.\n\nHe refuses to see all visitors. A dozen or more of his friends called at the holdover Sunday afternoon, but he refused himself from an interview with any of them. Later he sent for Capt. Reynolds, who is in charge of the Central police district, and requested that he be not disturbed by any more visitors. Soon after that two men presented themselves to the Captain. They asked for Allen, and when informed that he would not see them, they asserted that he would be glad to make an exception if he knew of their presence outside.\n\nIn his account of the affair, Confoy said Sunday afternoon that he was sure Allen was drunk when he fired. He also declared he had never before had a difficulty with Allen and seldom went into the Market Street place.\n\n\"I met John Spencer, formerly a barkeeper for Allen,\" said the dying man, \"and as we were walking up Market Street to go home, he proposed stepping into Allen's to drink a glass of beer. Before we had ordered the beer, Allen presented a pistol at us and began to fire. At first, I thought Allen was trying to shoot Spencer. The first bullet struck me in the arm and knocked me down. I was trying to escape when Allen fired again and again.\"\n\nHospital surgeons say the ball which caused Confoy's death entered the abdomen and perforated the intestines.\n\nA revolver was found on the floor near the spot where Confoy fell. It has not yet been identified as the dead man's property. His friends, while admitting that Confoy was a fighter and was inclined to hunt for a ruction when drinking, say they do not recall that he ever went about with a concealed weapon. If the pistol is shown to have been Confoy's, Allen's defense will be much stronger. Allen says, in direct contradiction to Confoy's dying statement, that he and Confoy had trouble some time ago and that when Confoy entered the saloon, he seemed to be seeking to renew the issue.\n\nConfoy roomed at 8168 Walnut Street. Until two or three weeks ago, he was employed as an agent of the Columbia Theater. Previously, he had worked as a stage hand at the Olympic and Standard theaters.\n\nAmong the theatrical mechanics and bill posters, to whom Confoy was well known, he had the reputation of being a ready fighter and a first-class man in a rough and tumble \"scrap.\" Some of them say they are not surprised to hear that Confoy should have been in a place notorious for its brawls, especially if he were drinking. On the other hand, they declare that Confoy, when not in his cups, was cool-headed and peaceable.\n\nThe Coroner's inquest on the death of Confoy will be held at 10 o'clock Tuesday morning.\n\nTom Allen was born in Birmingham, England, in 1830. He was 5 feet 8 inches tall, and when he was in the ring, his fighting weight was 175 pounds. Allen began his pugilistic career in the old country in 1861. He fought several stiff battles, including a draw with Joe Goss in March 1867. He came to this country in the following July, and in the very first ring event in which he participated, a revolver and threats to kill played star parts.\n\nAllen had been selected to second Tommy Kelly of Baltimore in a finish fight with Billy Parkinson of Pottsville, Pa. The mill took place at Acquia Creek, Vermont. The fight was for a $250 purse. Parkinson was feared by the backers of Kelly, and a large crowd of thugs and bullies accompanied Kelly from Baltimore and Philadelphia. It was arranged between them to start a row if the referee didn't give the fight to their man. William E. Harding, then sporting editor of a New York daily, and afterward preeminent through his connection with a sporting weekly published on pink paper, was the referee.\n\nFrom the first round, Parkinson began to hand it up to Kelly so cleverly that Tom Allen went wild. Before the signal to start the wrangle, he pulled forth a long navy pistol and announced that he would kill Harding if Kelly didn't get the decision on alleged fouls. Kelly's friends crowded around the referee, and for a moment, it looked as though Harding would be killed. Allen, who led the crowd, was desperate to the point of doing murder. But Harding would not be intimidated, and Allen, followed by his ruffianly mob, cut the ropes and carried Kelly out of the ring. Parkinson was, of course, declared the winner.\n\nAllen's first battle in America was with Bill Davis. The fight was pulled off on Chouteau Island, near St. Louis, Jan. 12, 1869. Allen won in 43 rounds. He next tried on Charley Gallagher of Cleveland, the fight taking place on Carroll Island, near St. Louis, the following Feb. 24. Allen was laid low after a terrific three minutes of fighting.\n\nMike McCoole of St. Louis and Allen fought on Foster's Island, July 15, for a $100 purse and all of the excursion money. A great crowd of St. Louisans went to see the mill, and they saw Allen give his adversary a mighty whaling. They also saw a bloody free-for-all riot started by the McCoole crowd. Clubs were wielded, while the referee was besieged by angry brutes armed with murderous weapons, who savagely demanded a decision in favor of the helpless, shapeless bleeding mass of humanity who had been a chopping block for Allen. These rows were characteristic of almost every fight Allen ever had.\n\nAllen afterwards took on Charley Gallagher a second time, defeating him on Foster's Island, Aug. 17, 1869. The crowd interfered as usual, and Gallagher was declared the winner, though fairly whipped.\n\nAllen's best-known fight was with Jem Mace at Kinnerville, near New Orleans, La., May 10, 1870. Sporting men from all over the country congregated to witness the fight. It was a short and bloody battle. Mace was too much for Allen and won the $500 prize in ten rounds.\n\nJoe Coburn declined to fight Allen, and Mike McCoole was accommodated with a second contest. They fought on Chouteau Island, Sept. 23, 1873. Allen made quick work of McCoole, punishing him so brutally that the spectators were shocked.",

    text: "Justifiable homicide was the verdict of the Coroner's jury Tuesday at the conclusion of the inquiry into the killing of Timothy Confoy by ex-pugilist Tom Allen Sunday morning. The prisoner was warmly congratulated as he was taken back to jail. Coroner Lloyd presided at the inquest. Allen was represented by Judge Harvey and Attorney Thomas F. Rowe. A large delegation of Allen's friends came to the City Hall to greet him as he was taken over from the Four Courts. The prisoner evinced no great pleasure at seeing them, but walked stolidly through the crowd.\n\nIn the Coroner's office, Allen was joined by Charlie Daly, who sat by him throughout the inquiry. William Sipe, a laborer who rooms at the Salvation Army Lodging House, Ninth and Market streets, was the first witness. He said he was in the back room when the shooting occurred. He could see Allen, but not the man he shot at. Before the shooting, he heard Allen ask in a loud voice, \"What have you got under your coat?\" then in a moment, \"What have you got in your hand?\" The shooting immediately followed the last question. Witness did not see a pistol near Confoy.\n\nLincoln Lyons, a Salvation Army boarder, saw Allen shoot. He saw a pistol under Confoy when the police picked him up. Half a dozen other men who were spending the night in the concert hall testified to hearing Allen asking, \"What've you got in your hand?\" and saw the policeman pick up the revolver from under Confoy. Robert Lyons, generally known as \"Higgins,\" was tending bar for Allen on the night of the shooting. \"I was behind the bar,\" he said, \"when Spencer and Confoy came in. Spencer called for a small beer and Confoy took sherry wine. When I set the drinks out, Confoy sipped his, then shoved it back. Allen asked him what was the matter with it. Confoy replied, 'It's like you—it's no good.'\n\n\"Allen replied: 'You're not a tough one, are you?' Confoy said: 'I guess I'm tough enough for you,' and put his hand in his pocket. Allen then asked what he had and told me to see. I saw Confoy's arm raise, as if to draw his hand from his pocket, then Allen began shooting. Confoy dropped at the fourth shot. As he fell, he threw his arms in the air and in one hand was a pistol. This dropped to the floor and he fell on it. During the shooting, Confoy was crying, 'I'm game, ain't I? I'm game.'\n\nWitness identified Allen's revolver and the revolver he said was in Confoy’s hand. After several more inmates of the back room were examined, John Spencer, Confoy's companion, was called. He said that he met Confoy at Dave Rilling’s saloon, Seventh and Walnut streets, at 1:40 Sunday morning. Confoy had been drinking and agreed with witness to go home. \"On our way,\" said Spencer, \"we dropped into Allen's. I ordered the drinks and asked Allen to join us, which he did. Confoy took his sherry, tasted it, and threw it away. Allen said, 'What's the matter with it? Take something else.' Tim replied, 'It's like you, no good.'\n\n\"Allen then asked if he was a 'tough mug,' and Confoy told him that he would make him think so. Allen asked him if he was looking for trouble and Tim said: 'I'd just as soon have trouble with you as anybody I know,' and put his hand in his overcoat pocket. Allen stepped behind the bar, got his gun, and pointed it at Confoy. 'You've come in here for trouble,' said Allen, 'and you've got a gun in your pocket. If you attempt to draw it I'll kill you.' Tim was drawing the gun when Allen began shooting. His first shot hit my finger and I retreated. Confoy dropped at the fourth shot, falling on his gun. Allen then went to the door and called for the police.\"\n\nJohn Daly of 821 Market Street testified to Confoy coming into his saloon about 11 o'clock Sunday morning. Confoy asked how he stood with Allen. Daly said \"all right.\" Confoy replied, \"Well, he's done me dirt and I'm going down to put him on the bum.\" Witness thought Confoy was \"sore.\" He was sure he was not fooling. After that remark, Confoy left Daly's place. Manager Charles P. Salisbury, Fent Farnham, and Robert A. Corkie, of the Columbia Theater, were called to tell of the deceased's character. They knew little about him. William Donahue, a stage hand at the Standard Theater, was at the City Hospital to see Confoy twice Sunday. That night he told the wounded man that the doctor said he was going to die, and asked him to make a statement. He said Confoy told him that he did not know why Allen shot him. There had never been any trouble between the two.\n\n\"He said the first he heard,\" testified the witness, \"was somebody saying, 'You bloody sucker, I'll get you first,' and then Allen began shooting. He said he asked Allen what this was for, and that Allen replied, 'I'll show you,' and fired again. He said he believed Allen had a grudge against Spencer because Spencer was formerly his bartender and quit him. Tim thought Allen was shooting at Spencer until he fell. He said he did not have a pistol.\"\n\nMore witnesses were heard relative to Confoy's custom of carrying a pistol. None knew him ever to have one. Attorney L. G. Peery identified the revolver found under Confoy as his property. He said Confoy came to his room in the Havlin Building between 10:30 and 11 o'clock Saturday night and asked for the revolver. He was asked what he wanted with it and replied \"Nothing, but I might need it.\" Mr. Peery thought Confoy had been drinking. The revolver was loaded. Patrolmen Clifford, McCormick, and Race testified to finding the revolver under Confoy in the saloon.\n\nThe case was then given to the jury. It returned in 10 minutes with a verdict of justifiable homicide.",
    summary: "Tom Allen, a retired 19th-century prizefighter, was acquitted of killing Timothy Confoy in St. Louis, deemed justifiable after Confoy allegedly drew a revolver first."

    text: "Excise Commissioner Higgins began the real work of closing the winerooms Tuesday morning. He started his deputy, R. P. Thompson, and Detective Tim Danaher out to notify the keepers of the places that their rooms must be suppressed.\n\nA beginning was made with the Central Police District. The first list given to Mr. Thompson included Market, Chestnut, and Pine streets, from Twelfth to the Levee. The notification given the wineroom keepers is peremptory. It admits of no parley. In substance, it was that all stalls, partitions, curtains, or other paraphernalia used to separate compartments intended as drinking places must be removed.\n\n\"Locking the doors won't do,\" said Mr. Higgins, in delivering instructions to Mr. Thompson. \"The places must either be removed entirely or nailed up.\" No time is given the keepers in which to suppress the rooms. The order was that they must be suppressed immediately. When instructions have been delivered to all of them, Mr. Higgins will look to the police to inform him whether the order has been obeyed. He says that part of the work will be left to the police. If the order is not obeyed, he declares that revocation of the licenses of the disobedient will follow at once.\n\n\"I will not tolerate either disobedience or evasion,\" he said. \"My order is such that no man need misunderstand, and I expect it to be obeyed.\"\n\nMr. Thompson and Detective Danaher began with Market street, east of Twelfth. The first place on the list is at Tenth and Market, kept by a man named Doyle. He was not in, and his bartender was disposed not to receive the order. It must be delivered to Mr. Doyle personally. \"You are his agent, and you will deliver the order to Mr. Doyle,\" said Mr. Jackson, decisively.\n\nHe and the detective then inspected the wineroom. It was a box-like stall in the rear of the saloon. The partition reached only halfway to the ceiling. The door had a lock to it. Mr. Thompson told the bartender that it must be removed at once.\n\nAt the next place, on the corner of Ninth and Market, the proprietor, Placht, was disposed to be argumentative. His establishment was divided from the rest of the saloon by a wall, pierced by a door, but this door was closed by a heavy curtain. The room also had a street door, but a view of the interior was cut off in that direction by a screen. The proprietor claimed that women never frequented his place, and that it was kept for the accommodation of young men who wanted to play cards. He tried to get Mr. Thompson to give him an interpretation of the order, arguing all the time that it did not apply to him. Mr. Thompson declined to enter into any discussion and told Mr. Placht that he must judge for himself whether he came under the order.\n\nAt the next corner, there were two winerooms, with electric bells, tables, and chairs. They clearly came under the order, and Mr. Thompson did not stop to parley with the proprietor, who claimed that women never frequented the place.\n\nDown in the next block, the officers struck Tom Allen's place. Tom has one room. He said no woman had been in the place in six months. Like Placht, he was disposed to argue the matter, offering to take the door to the room off its hinges. He was left to construe the order as he saw fit, after being told the penalty of failure to obey.\n\nThe most complete set of winerooms found on the trip down Market street were those kept by Tom Hause at Sixth and Market. Here eight rooms, handsomely fitted up, all opening on a dark hall, which winds around through the back of the house in a most erratic way, were found. The manager was told that they must all be removed. He said he would lock them up. The officers left him to take his own way of parsing the order.\n\nAnother curious outfit was found at Third and Market. It is called the \"Ice Palace,\" and is decorated to bear a faint resemblance to an icy grotto. There were three stalls and a large room in which was a piano. A woman sat at the piano, a half-consumed glass of beer at her elbow. The Excise Commissioner expects to finish the work of notifying the keepers in due course.",

    text: "Tom Allen, the veteran pugilist who won the first battle in England ever fought under Queensberry rules, and who was for years considered the strongest candidate for the heavyweight championship of the world, is lying sick at his home on Market street between Sixth and Seventh, and is believed to be seriously ill.\n\nPersistent colds, which have clung to him for the last two or three weeks, and which have confined him to his bed, are responsible for his condition. Although he has improved in the last day or two and hopes to be about again shortly, his sickness has reduced him considerably and has caused him considerable pain.\n\nThe veteran has been complaining of pains in the regions where his opponents’ punches landed in years gone by, and states that his arms, ribs, and stomach region have been throbbing where they sustained punishment in his battles of the past.\n\nAllen was a representative fighter of the old school and of the bygone bare-knuckle days. He started his ring career when 21 years old, in 1860, and for eighteen years he was a prominent factor among the foremost men in his class. Born in 1839, he took up the ring rather later than do most of the pugilists nowadays, and he continued at the game until his celebrated battle for the championship of England, when he knocked out Charlie Davis in five rounds. This was the first championship battle fought in England under Queensberry rules. As a reward, he received a purse of 11% and a massive silver cup, emblematic of the title, which now hangs over his bar.\n\nIn 1867 he fought the then celebrated Joe Goss for the heavyweight championship, the bout ending in a riot and Allen's seconds being mobbed. In 1870 he fought Jem Mace in Louisiana for the heavyweight championship and a purse of $5,000, Allen's seconds throwing up the sponge at the end of ten rounds, after Tom had injured his arm. The bout lasted fifty minutes. Allen's path around this city is well remembered, especially his battles with Mike McCool on Bloody Island. He beat McCool there in seven rounds.\n\nDon Murphy, manager of Allen's, stated that he believed the veteran would be out again soon, but that the effects of his illness had told on him considerably.\n\nNick Santora, who defeated Roe Sullivan in the preliminaries at the West End Club last Thursday, will be one of the attractions in the preliminaries next week, when Jeffries and Fitzsimmons appear here. Santora displayed great cleverness in his battle, and the boy seems to be about as promising a youngster as there is in the ring at his weight.\n\nDominick has none of the clumsiness usually apparent in boys of the 105-pound division and thereabouts, but handles both his feet and hands well. He has footwork down to a finer point than Sullivan, and undoubtedly is one of the hardest men at his weight ever here.\n\nHe is now not yet 17 years old, and has been fighting little more than a year. He has lost but one battle and forfeited one on a foul. All his bouts, save that of last Thursday, have been fought in Chicago. His record to date is: Knocked out Shay Sorensen in four rounds; knocked out Young Slasher in four rounds; knocked out Nell Simons, four rounds; drew with Carl Walters, six rounds; lost on foul to George Quinn, five rounds; drew with Geo. Quinn, six rounds; knocked out Danny Gillen, one round; drew with Frank Lucas, six rounds; knocked out Neill Simons, two rounds; lost to Ge Kelly, six rounds; won from Frank Lucas, six rounds; knocked out Buddy Glover, three rounds; won from Sport Sullivan, eight rounds.\n\nHugo Kelly, who won from Mike Schreck Thursday, will depart tonight for Chicago, thence heading for West Baden. Jake Chain, who represented him here, has a bantam named Johnny Kelly in his care and has issued a challenge to Harry Forbes for a bout at that weight. According to Chain, Hertz has promised to let Forbes meet Kelly before the Tokell bout and to make Harry weigh in at 113 pounds.\n\nChain is also seeking Tommy Love, one of the 118-pounders of the East, who is now in Chicago.",

    text: "Although the modern style of Queensberry fighting, with its padded gloves and numerous safeguards to boxers, would seem likely to lengthen a man's period of usefulness in the prize ring, more than one fighter of the bare-knuckle days could boast of a career extending over a longer period than the records of present-day fighters. Tom Allen, the veteran pugilist, who was a heavyweight championship candidate in the sixties and the seventies, and who is now ill at his home on Market Street, is a case in point. Starting his career as a fighter in 1857 and participating in some of the most gruelling battles ever fought with bare knuckles, he continued as a factor until 1878 when he won the championship of England, closing his career by capturing the first championship bout ever conducted in that country under Queensberry rules.\n\nAllen was 21 years old when he started fighting; 29 years old when he knocked out Charlie Davis for the British championship. Any pugilist of today who has reached the 30-year mark, save perhaps Bob Fitzsimmons alone, is regarded as anything but a championship factor. Yet Allen was not only considered a factor, but he also won the championship.\n\nOld Tom Allen, however, also fought when the bare fists cut and battered ring flesh, who figured in battles lasting through hours in the open air and fought in snow with the temperature close to the zero mark, who went through contests when mobs broke into the ring and battered the fighters around, was still a championship factor in his fortieth year, and was not considered a has-been by a great deal.\n\nOld Tom Kelly, who is another veteran of bygone pugilistic days and who still calls this city his home, fought bare-knuckle battles long after the time at which men retire from the ring nowadays. Enough instances may be found in looking over old-time pugilistic history to prove that the ring life of the bare-knuckle fighters, contrary to the general belief on the point, was at least as long as that of the boxers of today.\n\nTwo reasons may be given for this. One is the fact that the old-time battles were fought in the open air. The other, that speed was less essential in the bare-knuckle days than it is at present.\n\nThe open-air battles, even when fought in a driving snowstorm, as they often were, probably proved far less injurious to a man than a bout of today, conducted in a heated hall reeking with tobacco smoke. The fighters at least had pure air to breathe. And the value of this can be estimated by those who have noted the number of men collapsing as modern boxers after a short course of theatrical life.\n\nSteady inhalation of the air in a crowded theater each night, even when the men have remained in such an atmosphere but a few hours each day, has sapped the vitality from several champions. Steady work in a crowded boxing hall, where the lungs of the men draw tobacco smoke in with each panting breath, has undoubtedly proved more injurious to many a fighter than his opponent's blows.\n\nThen as to the matter of speed. A man loses that extreme edge of speed quicker than he loses his strength. Today, speed is an absolute essential; a man without it might just as well not enter the ring. In the old days, when the men set themselves for their blows and sent in their punches to do damage with each stroke, this extreme speed was not so essential.\n\nThe loss of this edge of speed removes a man from the front rank today. In the old days, a man was serviceable so long as his muscles were still in good trim and his strength was not waning. The result was that a fighter of ability might have a ring career at least as long as that of the ring heroes of today.\n\nConsiderable interest was aroused by the announcement of Allen's illness in yesterday's Republic, and the record of the old-timer was talked over among the fight lovers of the city. The contrast between the battles of today, in halls lined with police and where order prevails, and the celebrated bout between Allen and Joe Goss, when the ring was broken, revolvers drawn, seconds forced from their principals at the muzzles of guns and the ring stormed by a mob, furnished a lively topic of discussion.\n\nThe fight in question occurred in 1867 and was contested late in September on a stormy day. The affair was for a side bet of $2,500, and after a battle of thirty-seven rounds, lasting one hour and fifty minutes, friends of Goss burst into the ring and threatened to kill Allen and his seconds. Two men known as Red Leary and Blinky Morgan burst into the ring with drawn revolvers and drove his seconds away.\n\nAt that time, Goss was clearly beaten and was entirely blinded by Allen's blows. Tom was hardly injured in the fight, but in the subsequent attack by the mob, he was shot in the hand and was hit in the eye with a club. Red Leary and Blinky Morgan both met violent deaths, Leary being killed through being hit in the stomach with a bullet while Morgan was hanged at Columbus.\n\nAnother memorable fight of Allen's was in 1870, when he met Jem Mace in Louisiana for the championship of the world and a side bet of $2,500. Allen was badly punched in the body in the course of this fight, and his seconds threw up the sponge at the end of ten rounds. The contest lasted fifty minutes.\n\nIn 1878, Allen fought Charlie Davis in England under Queensberry rules, putting him away in five rounds. This gave him the British championship. His most notable fights locally, however, were those fought in the vicinity of this city. In one fight, he met Mike McCool on Bloody Island, winning easily in seven rounds.\n\nTom Kelly, who also lives in this city, is another veteran of bare-knuckle days, having been born in Roscommon County, Ireland, in 1836. He battled around pounds and was one of the best-known pugilists of his day. His ring career extended over a longer period than that of most modern pugilists, and while he never fought in this country, his record of battles on the other side of the water is a lengthy one. The fact that he frequently attended Donnybrook Fair and still survives attests his ability.\n\nOne thing may be added, however, and that is, that it was the successful pugilists who had the lengthy careers in the ring. Defeat in a bare-knuckle battle generally meant a terrible pounding and often served broken jaws and ribs. One hard battle was often enough to wreck a man’s constitution if he was the beaten fighter, who received the drubbing, and it was the victorious man, who could beat his opponent into submission readily, that had the career.",
    summary: "In the 19th-century, fighters like Tom Allen sustained lengthy careers in bare-knuckle boxing, performing grueling bouts against figures like Jem Mace, in harsh conditions."

She is Mrs. Tillie Hartgrove of St. Louis, who has been acting as his nurse during an illness which began last Christmas, and from which he is only now convalescing. Mrs. Hartgrove stated to the Post-Dispatch Friday morning that they contemplated matrimony before Allen was stricken, but now that the physicians have said his recovery is certain, the ceremony will take place as soon as possible.\n\nLike the convalescent pugilist, Mrs. Hartgrove is of English birth. She is a native of Manchester, but has been in St. Louis since she was nine years old. She says her first husband is dead. Allen has been a widower for more than twenty years.\n\nFor about twenty-three years Allen has been the proprietor of a small saloon with an English concert hall annex at 619 Market Street. The sign above the front door, “Champion's Rest,” is familiar to all St. Louisians who use the Market Street cars. For the same length of time, Allen has lived alone in apartments above the saloon. He met young Mrs. Hartgrove about two years ago.\n\n“She’s been taking mighty good care of the old man while he's been sick,” said Murphy, the bartender, who also sings in the annex, “and I know the old man thinks a whole lot about her. They'll get along all right, for the old man's got a big heart, even if he is a little cranky once in a while. He's often chased me out of here when he got mad, but he'd always send for me again.”\n\nAs he spoke, Murphy was standing in front of a glass case on the center of the bar in which rests a magnificent silver cup over two feet high. A placard on the case announces that it is the championship boxing cup of England. Allen won it April 17, 1878, when he defeated Charlie Davis in five rounds for a purse of £100.\n\nAt one end of the bar is a picture of the proprietor in ring costume as he appeared on Sept. 23, 1873, when he won the championship of America by defeating Mike McCool in seven rounds for a $2000 purse. This contest is said to have occurred in St. Louis.\n\nAt this time, Allen, who was born in Birmingham, April 23, 1839, and who fought in England from 1860 to 1867, had been in America for six years. He was the proprietor of a saloon in Cleveland then.\n\nAfter a fight with Joe Goss in Kentucky, Sept. 7, 1876, warrants were sworn out for both Goss and Allen for violating a statute against prizefighting. Goss was arrested and given a two-year sentence. Allen, however, skipped from Kentucky back to “merry old England” and waited until the five-year statute of limitations expired. Then he returned and located in St. Louis, conducting a saloon on Washington Avenue, between Fourth Street and Broadway, for a few years before removing to his present location.\n\nSince then, Tom Allen has not fought professionally. He invested some of his ring money in Missouri farms, which he is said to still have. His saloon made him a living in the interval.\n\n“The Champion's Rest” is not a fashionable resort. It is an establishment where the “hobo” is as welcome as anyone else. The concert hall annex is a lounging place for laborers and others not blessed with much of the world's goods. Every night a piano is played there and popular or sentimental songs are sung to the accompaniment while the listeners sip refreshments.\n\nUntil stricken with kidney trouble, Tom Allen was always about his place, day and night, mingling with his patrons, who admire him extravagantly. They are always ready to listen to his stories of fistic fun of the past.\n\nMrs. Hartgrove, whom the proprietor of “The Champion's Rest” will marry, is a small, dark-haired young woman with black eyes and a pleasing manner. The man she says she will marry is 5 feet 9½ inches tall, and in fighting condition weighed 170 pounds. Now he weighs more."

    text: "“Anyone who crosses that threshold without my consent is a dead man,” said W. A. Byrne, who is in possession of the living rooms over Tom Allen's Champion Rest, at 619 Market Street. Byrne stood with one hand on the knob of the half-open door at the head of the stairs and the other grasping a six-shooter. Tom Allen, owner of the Champion's Rest, lies dead in an undertaker’s room, but occupants of the Rest are prepared for war.\n\nByrne, who holds the living rooms, represents J. W. L. Gillespie of the Hyde Park bar. Gillespie says he has a claim against Allen for goods sold to him. The barroom on the lower floor of the building directly beneath the living rooms is held by John Murphy, the old bartender for Allen, who is said to be acting in the interest of Mrs. Mary Taylor of 2427 Clark Avenue, a daughter of Allen. Byrne, who occupies the living rooms, has his wife and three children with him. They moved in last Tuesday.\n\n“Mr. Gillespie put me here to keep possession of this place and I'm going to keep it,” said Byrne, Monday morning. “The whole police force cannot enter here except over my dead body. Neither can anybody else unless I say so.”\n\nByrne is six feet tall and powerfully built. He was stripped for action Monday morning, having coat and collar off and sleeves rolled back. The six-shooter lay in an open drawer three feet from the outside door. Byrne does not go to the door, however, without it in hand.\n\n“What do you want?” he demanded in answer to a rap Monday morning. After a series of searching questions, he drew a heavy bolt and opened the door enough for his face and the barrel of the six-shooter to be seen.\n\n“You see, I'm prepared for business,” he remarked. “And I never saw any man that I was afraid of.\n\n“While I was away yesterday they came up here with a big, burly policeman and told my wife she'd have to get out because they wanted to bring Allen's body here. I wish I had been here. I'd have made them hard to find.\n\n“She told them they could bring Allen's body here and have the front room but she refused to move out and they went away. They'd better not come again.”\n\nByrne says he had no trouble until Sunday. He says he had charge of the saloon last week in Gillespie's name and got along well with Murphy, the bartender.\n\n“Murphy's got a bad man named Lyons helping him,” said Byrne. “But that don’t make any difference.”\n\nByrne says his supporters have the Allen will and will file it Monday. The claim of Gillespie will then be presented in the Probate Court, but Byrne says he will retain the living rooms until the court acts.\n\nAllen, formerly world's champion heavyweight pugilist, died Sunday morning in the Baptist hospital at the age of 61. His body is at the undertaking rooms. Litigation over his estate will probably be commenced forthwith. Mrs. Mary Taylor of 2427 Clark Avenue says she will apply to the courts to have the property taken care of. She alleges it is being dissipated by persons who have no right to it.\n\nThe report that Allen was about to marry Mrs. Hartgraven caused Mrs. Taylor to make an attempt to see her father at the Baptist Hospital, but the persons in charge said he was too ill to talk to anyone.\n\nShortly after, J. W. L. Gillespie, who said he had a bill of sale transferring the property to him, went to the saloon and tried to induce John Murphy, who has worked for Allen for years, to turn over the saloon. Gillespie said he had a bill of sale. In the dispute which followed guns were drawn but Murphy remained in charge.\n\nMrs. Hartgraven, the woman Allen was reported to be engaged to, was married to an Englishman and it is said she has not been divorced. It is reported there will be various claimants to the estate.\n\nTom Allen won the championship of the world in the days when fighters did not use gloves. He was the last of the old school of pugilists like Heenan and Sayres. He lost the championship and then regained it. Since he has been in America, St. Louis has been his home. He was champion of England when he came to the United States in 1869.\n\nTom Allen's will was filed in the probate court Monday. It bequeaths $10 each to his two sisters and leaves the balance to Mrs. Tillie Hartgrove, to whom he was reported to be engaged, and who has had charge of his affairs since his illness. The will is dated March 24, 1903. The witnesses are Dr. Heine Marks, Dr. E. R. Newcomb, and Charles Brock.\n\nAttorney Simon Bass filed the document. It gives no estimate of the value of the estate and contains no inventory of his personal property. The testament is couched in the driest of legal verbiage, containing the statement that the testator is of sound mind and that no undue influence has been brought to bear to induce him to dispose of his property. Hartgrove, the beneficiary, has had charge of the saloon, “The Champions Rest,” during Allen's illness and is said to have a bill of sale for it. She is said to have a husband living in England.",

    text: "Tom Allen, retired champion pugilist of the world, died early yesterday morning at the Baptist Hospital. As the proprietor of \"The Champion's Rest\" at No. 615 Market Street, Tom Allen was known as the \"champion,\" and any man who dared call him the \"ex-champion\" had him to settle with.\n\nAllen was the only man in the history of the ring during the time when no gloves were used in contests that lost the championship and then regained it. He was defeated by Jem Mace in a ten-round go on May 10, 1870, and regained the belt on November 5, 1870, when he won from Jem Gallagher in fourteen rounds.\n\nTom Allen, while he had been one of the eccentric characters of St. Louis for years, perhaps, received more notoriety in the last few weeks than any time since he quit the prize ring. Becoming ill, he was nursed by a woman who claimed he was to marry her after he recovered. She was yet to be divorced from her husband. Allen still had a wife living in Birmingham, England.\n\nAllen's place on Market Street, which years ago was given the name of \"The Champion's Rest\" and the headquarters of the \"Albion Social Club,\" is today one of the most notorious resorts in the city, not that it is in any way dangerous, but that it is the resting place of a large number of the city's unfortunates who have no means with which to secure a place to rest.\n\nFor years \"Old Tom,\" as his patrons were wont to style him, personally conducted the affairs of the \"Champion's Rest.\" His characteristic pose was to preside over the piano and direct the concert which took place nightly.\n\nSix weeks ago, when Allen took to his bed, he was given the best of attention. When his condition became serious he was removed to the Baptist Hospital. From the time he was taken there until his death he was in a comatose condition, rarely if ever recognizing anybody.\n\nAccording to his friends, efforts to obtain from him a statement or to induce him to make a will are said to have been fruitless. After the champion was removed to the hospital from his rooms over the saloon, various persons endeavored to secure an interview with him. Principally among these was his daughter, Mrs. Mary Taylor, of No. 3427 Clark Avenue. She discredited the report that her father was to marry his nurse, Mrs. Tillie Hartgraven.\n\nMrs. Taylor attempted to secure an interview with her father, but this was denied her, because, it was stated, he was in no condition to receive visitors. About the same time, J. W. L. Gillespie appeared at the \"Rest\" and attempted to take possession, claiming he had been given a bill of sale for the place by Allen.\n\nJohn Murphy, who has been one of Allen's faithful employees for many years, knowing that the champion was unconscious and in no condition to give a bill of sale, declined to surrender the place and ordered Gillespie away.\n\nFollowing the Gillespie incident, it is claimed, a safety deposit box, which Allen kept, has been broken into and $39, together with a watch and chain, the latter given the champion by an admiring friend years ago, stolen.\n\nAllen's body is at the undertaking establishment of Thomas Wand. Litigation over his estate probably will be instituted before the funeral arrangements are completed, as his daughter, Mrs. Taylor, has declared that she will apply to the courts today to secure protection for her father's property.\n\nTom Allen was born at Birmingham, England, April 22, 1835. His first fight of consequence was on April 20, 1860, when he fought in England, in ten rounds. His longest fight was fifty rounds with Bob Smith, June 2, 1864, when he was defeated.\n\nAllen fought eleven important fights in England. He came to America as the champion of England in 1868. On May 10, 1870, he was beaten by Jem Mace for the championship of the world in a ten-round contest, but regained the title on September 23, 1873, when he defeated Mike McCoole in seven rounds.\n\nAllen fought several battles in which he was robbed either of the money or the decision. On two occasions the friends of his adversaries broke into the ring and forced the referees to give in, the threat being made with revolvers and other weapons.\n\nAdorning the back bar of the \"Rest\" is a silver cup which was presented to Allen in England. It is known as the \"Champion Boxing Cup of England.\" The champion regarded the cup as the greatest treasure he had. He returned to England in 1877, where he defeated Charlie Davis for the championship in England in five rounds. His last fight was on March 19, 1879, when he defeated Jim Stewart in England, in fifteen rounds.\n\nHe then came to America and, locating in St. Louis, opened a saloon which he styled \"The Champion's Rest,\" the name by which the place is known today. The funeral will probably take place Wednesday morning from his home over No. 615 Market Street.\n\nTom Kelly, who runs a saloon on Market Street, also a former pugilist, was a warm friend of the dead champion. He figured in many fistic encounters in England and was once defeated by a brother of Allen. Kelly was here when Allen arrived in the United States in 1869.\n\nAt the time of his arrival in this country, pugilism was just getting popular in the United States and Allen had a strong following. The veteran fighter came directly to St. Louis and it was near this city that he engaged in his first fight.\n\nHe was matched to fight Bill Davis, an aspirant for championship honors, and the fight took place not many miles from St. Louis. London prize ring rules prevailed and Allen won in the forty-third round. The fight lasted forty minutes and the side bet was $1000. On that occasion Thomas Kelly seconded Allen.\n\nAllen then fought Charles Gallagher and Jem Gallagher. In each of these battles Kelly acted as a second to Allen's opponent. In Allen's battle with Joe Goss in 1876, Kelly acted as second to the champion.\n\n\"I saw the first and the last battle that Allen engaged in in this country,\" said Kelly last night. \"I followed the career of the man during his palmy days, sometimes seconding him and sometimes seconding his opponents. He was as game a fighter as ever stepped into an arena, and whether for or against him, I always admired him. He was a square fellow and all of his battles were honest ones.\"\n\nThe last fight Allen engaged in in the United States was with Joe Goss, whom he had previously defeated in England. Goss's friends outnumbered those of Allen, and the referee, it is claimed, favored Allen's opponent.\n\nThe fight was for $2500 a side—the largest amount that had ever been wagered on a prize fight up to that time. The fight took place near St. Louis and lasted thirty-seven rounds. In this round Allen landed a blow that put Goss to the ground. Goss's friends immediately rushed into the ring and claimed a foul.\n\nAccording to the Allen version of the story, the referee, being a friend of Goss, allowed the claim. The fight lasted one hour and fifty minutes and was one of the most fiercely contested battles in the history of the prize ring. Recognized sporting authorities admitted that Allen had fairly won the battle, and he retained the heavyweight championship of the world.",

    text: "\"Champion's Rest\" will soon be no more. The dingy, wretched, forbidding-looking shop at 615 Market Street, where former Champion Pugilist Tom Allen held iron sway for 21 years, known to followers of the fighting game in two continents as the home of an oracle on the sport, and to many thousand drifting \"hoboes\" as a house to chalk with a credit mark, will shortly follow its presiding genius into oblivion, so far as the general public is concerned.\n\nIts name will be retained, but announcements made by those into whose hands the dead pugilist's assets will fall are to the effect that the place will be altered, improved, and brought up to date. Gilt and tinsel will be introduced where once everything was as plain as the leg of a kitchen table—made so to suit the whim of the proprietor. Alterations will only mean the total effacement of one of the city's landmarks.\n\nReema if the dead champion, out in Bellefontaine Cemetery, could have a voice in the matter, not a chair would be moved, nor a chromo on the dingy wall changed, nor an improvement made, except, perhaps, to renew the daily distribution of clean sand on the floor. If those were consulted who followed the living to the cemetery Wednesday, square-faced, deep-chested men of the stripe of Allen himself, would there be any vote for a change. The establishment bore the stamp of Allen himself and for this it was known and in its way appreciated.\n\nLoudest in the protest against change will be the flotsam of humanity that Allen was wont to harbor on cold nights, and that he undemonstratively benefited for 20 years. For these, it was not merely a place where amusement could be purchased cheaply, but a haven when the winter winds pierced bitingly through threadbare garments and diligent search of pockets revealed a melancholy emptiness of wherewithal. Grimy, almost as themselves, the Champion's Rest invited them then. \"Improved\" it will be no place for them.\n\nThough its identity as representative of the man Allen will be lost with the \"up-to-date\" improvements contemplated, the memory of \"Champion's Rest,\" as it is today, will be difficult to efface. For nearly a quarter-century, it has stood, one of the unique places of its kind in the city.\n\nTwenty years ago, and indeed today, prospective visitors to Allen's place paused and thought twice before entering. It had an unsavory exterior, and the appearance of the majority of its patrons, with concave profiles and unshaven faces, did not inspire confidence. Yet, Allen's place was much worse looking than it was in reality. In all the score or more years of its existence, the place has never figured much in police annals. It has never been considered a dangerous place for anyone to enter, and Allen always thought himself in honor bound to protect his guests from possible trouble. Thieves he could not tolerate and drove them from his establishment as soon as their identity was made known.\n\nOnce the prospective visitor had made up his mind to enter the place and cross the threshold, he found himself in the \"tap room,\" as Allen was wont to refer to it. On the right was the dingy walnut counter with a mirror in back, in front of which was piped, the cup emblematic of Allen's English championship victory. On the left was a row of stalls. Beyond was the concert hall, still maintained as such. In the northwest corner was the prize ring in which bouts of some sort, many of them desperate, were held nightly. On the opposite side of the hall was a raised platform on which was placed the piano.\n\nNear this was a table at which the champion himself sat with a small gavel in hand and a black skull cap on his head, directing the evening's entertainment. He was referee of all fights, director of the musical entertainment, and arbitrator of all difficulties that might arise. In the early days of the establishment, these were not a few. Whenever two guests thought it necessary to throw a few hot words and get violent, Tom promptly rapped his gavel. At once the waiters dropped their tasks and flocked to the scene of action, where the combatants were separated, gloves tied on their hands, and they were told to climb into the ring and have their argument out there.\n\nThis had a triple advantage; it offset police interference, ended the difficulty to the satisfaction of the aggrieved parties, and afforded infinite entertainment to the spectators. As soon as one or the other of the combatants signified that his honor was saved or that he had had about all he could stand at one taking, the ring was cleared and the concert permitted to proceed.\n\nSometimes the encounters were desperate and savage, however. A few years after Allen had opened his place, Tom Kelly opened a similar groggery in the same block, while Danny Daly, father of several pugilistic celebrities, opened a place around the corner on Sixth Street. The rivalry for patronage between these three places was intense, and each had its coterie of followers, most of whom were pugilists, ready to fight at the drop of an eyelid, and at all times ready to uphold the claims of their respective establishments.\n\nThe bitterness thus engendered resulted in street brawls, saloon fights, and ring combats. Even old Tom himself, though he was long out of the game, occasionally took a hand in the fray. Once or twice the enemy, primed with raw spirits, dared to invade the old lion in his lair and proceeded to heap abuse on him. Then Allen proceeded to show his championship form and put the enemy out bodily.\n\nOnce the tables were turned on him, and, in an attempted invasion of Dan Daly's \"joint,\" a fight occurred in which he and Daly had it hammer and tongs clear out into the street. Daly whipped Allen—about the only occasion in which the champion ever finished second after leaving the ring. With constant brawling and scrapping to enliven it, this feud, growing more bitter each year, lasted until the death of Daly in 1895. It is natural to suppose that, under the circumstances, Allen would have been glad rather than otherwise that his ancient enemy had been finally disposed of. Such was not the case, however. It was characteristic of the man that he was one of the first to go to Daly's relatives, following the news of the death, and offer his services and substantial aid in money.\n\nWith Daly, the feud died, and the wane of the prize fighting feature of the \"Champion’s Rest\" began. There were fewer occasions for fights, and, who knows, perhaps even the old champion himself wearied of continual turmoil, broil, and unrest.\n\nFighting was far from being the sole feature of the establishment, however, in the earlier days. Allen was a lover of music. In a way, it was a sort of paradox of nature, for, in the ring as a fighter, he is said to have been one of the most savage and vicious men who ever fought under London prize ring rules. He had to be killed to be beaten, and it was his bulldog tenacity of purpose that pulled him through on top of many engagements. His appreciation of tender ballads, rollicking songs, and even classical music was of the keenest, and in his later days, he would rather listen to a song.",
    summary: "The article laments the impending transformation of \"Champion's Rest,\" once a haven for impoverished pugilist fans and a testament to 19th-century boxing champion Tom Allen's rugged legacy."

    text: "The death of Tom Allen, the old-time pugilist, in St. Louis last week recalls the famous fight between Allen and Joe Goss, which took place in Kentucky on September 7, 1876. The mill went 21 rounds and Allen lost on an intentional foul. He saw that his life was in danger if he won and deliberately struck Goss while he was down. The battle ground was in Boone County, on the farm of the father of Rome Respess, the well-known Cincinnati horseman. Goss was declared champion of America.\n\nThe fight was attended with many exciting incidents. Eph Holland, at the time one of the leading sports and promoters of the Queen City, was the prime mover of the affair. The day's events will be readily recalled by hundreds of Cincinnatians, who remember what a time there was.\n\nJem Wace brought Goss to the country with him, and the latter took up his headquarters in Cincinnati. Goss and Allen being English born and aspiring for the same honor, a feeling of bitterness sprang up between them. A match was arranged after some wrangling. The stake was $2,000 a side, which at that time was considered a large amount to battle for in the ring. When the men signed the articles it was noted that both were baldheaded. This created much amusement among the sports, and the match was frequently referred to as the \"Old Men's Bout.\" The fighters trained in this city. Goss prepared near Cumminsville, while Allen went to a point beyond Carthage, where he could enjoy the fresh country air. Allen, it is said, trained faithfully, but Goss put in most of his time chatting with friends who came from Cincinnati to see him \"work\" and incidentally drink a few dozen bottles of ale. The day of battle arrived.\n\nIt was early on the morn of September 7 in the year 1876 that the sports began to move about. In the resorts around town nothing else was talked of but the fight between the two old baldheads. Many of the faithful stayed up all night so as not to miss any of the early excitement incidental to the fight.\n\nEph Holland was the busiest man in town. He was in charge of the special train which was to be run to the battle ground, and was kept answering questions and giving instructions. The sports were told to be at the Little Miami Depot, at Pearl and Butler streets, at an early hour, from which point the train would leave. When Holland and the backers of the men reached the depot they found a howling mob awaiting them. The special train was filled with hoodlums, and it was impossible to get another soul on board. Holland had to resort to strategy to prevent a riot, as the bums in possession of the train announced that they would neither pay nor give up their seats. Then it was that Holland put his wits to working. He had the yardmaster take the train scheduled to leave for the fight down the road some distance, and when far from the battle ground the crowd on board was quickly informed that the train would go no further. Out in the wilderness the mob was left without a bite to eat and nothing to drink. Another train was hastily made up in the depot and the real moneyed men carried to the fighting ground. The \"bum special\" did not get in until late in the evening, and the sports who thought they were going to see the fight when they started, made for their homes, too much chagrined to relate their experience to those who made inquiries concerning the fight.\n\nThe regular fight train arrived at the scene of battle in Kenton County just about breakfast time. The men prepared their race and were soon at it hot and heavy. In the midst of the milling the cry was heard: \"The soldiers are coming.\" A glance convinced the sports that the militia were upon them and the state was colored stopped. The Captain of the militia told the promoters that they must not fight in Kenton County. The mob then moved into the adjoining County of Boone, and there on a level piece of farming land the fight was pulled off without further interference.\n\nThere was one woman spectator present. She said her name was Gorman, and the sports made a place for her at the ringside. She had read of the fight match and seemed much interested.\n\nThe fight was started. Goss showed much cleverness, but it was plainly apparent that Allen had the strength of the pair. Eph Holland was referee, and what a time he had. Every few seconds some one would call him a vile name or set up the claim of foul. The friends of Goss seemed to outnumber the men on Allen's side, and it was not long before it became noised about that if Allen did win, his life would pay the penalty. Allen had Goss groggy, but every time Allen knocked him down the Goss party would hoot old Tom so as to rattle him.\n\nIn the twenty-first round Allen rushed Goss and planted a hard blow in the wind. Goss groaned and sat down. It was then that the friends of Goss uttered violent threats against Allen, and the latter became frightened. He knew that his life was in danger. Suddenly, with a determined look in his eye, he walked over and smashed Goss, while he was attempting to rise. There was a burst of indignation from Goss's supporters, and a rough house ended the battle. Goss was given the decision, while Allen was hooted from the ring. It was plainly evident that Allen could have whipped Goss to a certainty, but he was afraid to punch him on account of the surroundings. Both men were arrested, but Allen, after getting out on bail, fled to England. Goss died years ago in the city of Boston, while Allen, after returning to this country, took up his abode in St. Louis, where he conducted a saloon known as the \"Champion Rest,\" up until a few weeks of his death.",

    text: "Brooklyn Tommy Sullivan's victory over Clarence Forbes was won by a narrow margin, but the Eastern fighter was justly entitled to the verdict. Save in the closing round and in the first few minutes of the battle, he had the better of the contest, and his cleaner and straighter hitting gave him a margin that could not be denied. Forbes proved something of a disappointment, so far as style was concerned, the general expectation being that he would go in to make a hurricane fight out of last Thursday's battle. It was probably this very unanimity of opinion that made him change his methods. Knowing that Sullivan might expect a rushing fight and train for that sort of a battle, Clarence probably decided to fool him by trying to spar.\n\nFor the first few rounds, it appeared as if this change of tactics was going to result in favor of the Chicago man. Sullivan did not look at his best in the ring and seemed drawn and worn. His color was not of the best, and Forbes, though somewhat soft in the stomach region, apparently looked to have slightly the edge in condition.\n\nThis may have been merely in appearance, as Sullivan put up a fight which indicated considerable stamina. He took a good hard walloping in part of the battle, but his straighter punches resulted in his landing more effectively than his opponent.\n\nBoth verdicts handed down in the course of last Thursday's exhibitions were strictly correct. Mal Doyle was perfectly justified in disqualifying Feeney, in spite of the fact that the latter had an immense lead at the time, and Paul Fisher handed down a decision which was considered just when he awarded the battle to Sullivan.\n\nAbout the only unpleasant incident of the main bout was the tendency on the part of both men to hit a trifle low, but as this was clearly unintentional and no harm was done, the slight fouling was allowed to pass without penalty.\n\nThe description of the prize fight between Joe Goss and Tom Allen, fought near Cincinnati in 1876, and recently reprinted in a paper of that city, is of interest, as showing the contrast between fights as conducted today and the old-time system of pulling off battles.\n\nThe fight in question was held on September 7, and the ring was pitched just across the river in Kentucky. Jem Mace, then the best-known boxer in England, brought Joe Goss to this country with him and established him in Cincinnati. Allen had also come to this country from England some years before, and considerable feeling existed between the men. It was decided to get them together in the ring, and a stake of $2,000 was arranged. This was considered a large sum in those days to depend upon a fight.\n\nEph Holland, a Cincinnati sporting man, was in charge of the affair and selected a site in Kenton County as the place for the ring. Arrangements had been made to have a special train carry the sports across the river, but this train was seized by a mob of toughs, who refused to leave the cars or to pay their fare. Holland was equal to the occasion, however. He had the yardmaster attach an engine to the train and haul it down the road for several miles. Then in a lonely spot, the mob was informed that the cars would go no further. The bums were forced to straggle back to the city as best they could.\n\nThe sports were then placed in another train, made up hurriedly, and they were hauled across the river. In Kenton County, a squad of militia met the train and informed the promoter that the bout could not be held there. The ring was accordingly moved over into Boone County, and there was pulled off.\n\nAllen lost the fight on a deliberate foul, but those who witnessed the contest state that it was one of the greatest battles of its time. One woman was present, and a place was made for her at the ringside. Eph Holland served as referee and had a hard time of it. Every moment some friend of one or the other fighter would apply vile epithets to him and set up the claim of foul.\n\nGoss showed considerable cleverness at the start, but it was soon evident that Allen was his master. The latter smashed Joe at pleasure in the last few rounds, and in the twenty-first round, he knocked him completely off his feet. Joe's friends made such an uproar, however, that Allen became frightened and struck Goss while the latter was on the ground, clearly intending to lose on a foul. Holland then gave the verdict to Goss.\n\nThe day was cold and raw, and the spectators had an uncomfortable time at the ringside. The date was September 7, the same day on which Jim Corbett won the championship from Sullivan, sixteen years later. In spite of the precautions taken to get rid of the tough element, enough of the dangerous characters had reached the ringside to make everyone keep a close watch on his pockethook.\n\nBoth fighters were bald-headed, and this fact created considerable amusement. No telegraphic connections were available near the scene of the battle, and the excitement was intense in Cincinnati as to who had won the contest.\n\nThe troubles of the men did not cease when the fight came to an end. Both were arrested and released on bail. Goss promptly left the country for England. He returned later and died in Boston about fifteen years ago. Allen died in St. Louis about one month ago. The scene of their famous bout was on a farm belonging to the father of Rome Respass, the well-known horseman.",

    text: "Denizens of Market street, whose habitat is the saloons between Sixth and Tenth streets, have a mystery. They are trying to account for the ringing of Tom Allen’s bell.\n\nWhen Tom named the place \"Champion’s Rest,\" he thought only of the rest for his old age, which it was to be. Tom Allen, retired champion pugilist and proprietor of Champion's Rest, in dying, left much litigation. His housekeeper, Tillie Hartgrove, took possession under a document purporting to be the will of Tom Allen, while Allen's daughter was left out in the cold, so far as a share in the inheritance went.\n\nProceedings to dispossess the housekeeper were brought by the daughter before the father was fairly buried, but the court probated the will and a manager was put in to run the place. This manager had been a bartender under Allen, and he knew the ways of Allen well enough to keep the old trade and run the place as Allen had done. But he did not see it that way, and the “Weary Willies” that used to bunk under the piano were unceremoniously turned out whenever the midnight trade fell off enough to warrant shutting the doors that in Allen's time had never been locked.\n\nThe nice ring simplicity that had characterized the place in the champion's regime was to give way to the tinsel and glitter of the modern bar. Sawdust was no longer to cover the floor, and a measurer from a carpet house was called in to make estimates for a linoleum outfit. Outside the door, the old patrons of the place often stopped and many a head was shaken with the remark: “Poor, old Tom. Wouldn't he turn over in his grave at such goings on.”\n\nThe man from the carpet house was figuring at a table in the concert hall, a table where Joe Allen used to sit and drink his ice water. With him sat the manager and two tall glasses adorned the table. A sound of warring voices rose above the noise of traffic on the street, and the two men went to the door. Suddenly the bell behind the bar rang. There was only one push button connected with it and no one had used it except Allen when he wanted a drink or a bouncer to quell a riot.\n\n“What are you doing to that bell, you rascal?” shouted the manager at the negro porter. “I never touched it, sah,” returned the porter. Again it sounded, more insistently than before. The porter retreated to the end of the bar nearest the door and again the bell rang out followed by a crash of glasses.\n\nThe manager was game, and he walked back into the concert hall. There on the table where the carpet salesman had been figuring was a pool of what had been “forty-rod” whisky highballs. Both glasses were broken and the estimate of the salesman, which had been written with an indelible pencil, blotted and blurred beyond the power of man to decipher.\n\n“What was it,” said the carpet man, “a cat?” “Cats don’t ring bells,” said the manager, “and we haven't a cat about the place.” “Well, what do you think it was?” insisted the carpet man as he started to make out a new estimate on the linoleum question. “I don't think anything about it; but say, we might as well call this deal off. Tom Allen don’t want no linoleum on his floor and I guess sawdust will be the carpet of this place while I run it.\"\n\nThe new plate glass mirrors were taken out the same day and the old wrinkled one put back behind the bar. The place is again just as Tom Allen left it and the old trade is coming back to be well received. This mystery has not been brought to the notice of the Society for Psychical Research as yet, but the Market street world grows more confident each day that it was nothing else than the spirit of Tom Allen come back to this world to make known to the new regime that the old ways and surroundings had been good enough for him and to protest against the planned innovations.\n\nOver the push button will be placed a box, that no strange hand may press it unawares. As for the habitues, they give that table a wide berth, not, as they say, that they are afraid, but, “Tom might not like it, you know,” is the reason assigned. None of the many visitors of the past few days has failed to be impressed with the story except an advance agent of a well-known actress, who was run out of the place in a hurry because he winked at the manager during the telling of the story."

It may go to Allen's widow in Birmingham, England.\n\nWhen Allen died, his daughter, Mrs. Polly Taylor, who resides in St. Louis, informed Mr. Strode that her mother was living, and that her father had not been divorced.\n\nStrode declined to pay any claims against the estate until he could ascertain if it amounted to more than a widow's immediate allowances, which comes in ahead of all claims, including funeral expenses.\n\nStrode also informed the undertaker who conducted Allen's funeral. The undertaker insisted on Mrs. Hartgrove paying in advance for the funeral, which she did, it is stated.\n\nMrs. Hartgrove nursed Allen in his last illness. He was to marry her had he lived, it was said.\n\nStrode filed an inventory of Allen's estate in probate yesterday. It describes the old piano which was used at concerts in Allen's saloon on Market near Seventh Street; a champion’s cup, a horse and set of harness; a barrel of whisky; bottled goods, furniture, clothing, pictures, and other property.\n\nAllen left $10 each to Mrs. Taylor and his daughter, Mrs. J. H. Newey of Birmingham, England, but made no mention of his wife. He named Attorney Simon Bass executor, but he declined to act, and the Public Administrator was appointed to take charge of the estate.\n\nMr. Strode said yesterday an attorney had been engaged to present the claim of Allen's widow."

    text: "\"Ome right in, gentlemen; see the pictures of the McCoy-Maher fight, illustrated songs, the marvelous contortion act, and other interesting features. Beats free.\"\n\nIt is the \"barker\" in front of the old \"Champion's Rest,\" once owned by that notorious of all heavyweight pugilists, Tom Allen, but now governed by Jack, a man from Klondike.\n\nThe \"barker\" is to the Market Street element. When he has finished, the stragglers file into Tom's resort and take seats. Allen’s place is the summer garden of Market Street. It is there that the member of the hobo element finds his retreat.\n\nThere isn’t much fresh air in this summer garden. Allen used to direct entertainment in the \"amphitheater\" of the Champion's Rest. Nowadays, his place is filled by Gillespie. The Market Street summer garden is operated like all summer gardens. No admission is charged at the door, but it costs one—even the hobo—something to get out. It may be that Allen's resort is operated upon a better business principle.\n\nNumbered among it are the proverbial hoboes who have seen better days. Many of them are the sons of farmers. Some, even, have fathers who are better established in the business world. Talk with the members of the Allen audience and you will find, not occasionally, but frequently, men whose fathers are bankers, brokers, or well-to-do merchants in cities.\n\nHow did they get in their present condition? There is almost the same reason for every man. He left home when a mere boy, tried to get work and failed, took to drink and begged, became a tramp, concluded after a while that he wasn't good for anything else. Then he became a professional hobo. Occasionally he finds work. He makes a few dollars, and as soon as he is paid off, he spends them. The only real pleasure he gets out of life is in having a few dollars and in spending them. And the place he spends them is just such a resort as this one formerly operated by a pugilist and now in the hands of the Klondike fortune-seeker.\n\nAllen used to regale his patrons with stories of his famous encounters. Gillespie tells them weird tales of the frozen North. The king is dead, and the new monarch is giving satisfaction. No one utters a word of protest. The same men frequent the Champion's Rest, and the schooners and the prices are the same as in the days of old. On the floor of the Champion's Rest, there is sawdust. It would not be the Champion's Rest if there was not sawdust on the floor.\n\nThere is an air about the place that breathes a welcome to the downtrodden hobo, and when he is there, he knows that he is at home. The program begins about 8 o'clock. It generally requires fifteen minutes of patient work to get the picture machine in operation, for Gillespie bought it second-hand, and at times it has to be coaxed. Very often the pictures are dim, for the film has been used many, many times, but the entertainment is free, and the hobo is satisfied, even if everything is not conducted in good style.\n\nAs a matter of fact, there are only six rounds to the McCoy-Maher fight, but somehow Gillespie manages to pull off a long fight, and, although his patrons never seem to realize it, the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth rounds are repeated at every performance. The sixth round, in which the knockout is scored, is held back pending purchases, and the unsuspecting patron of the Market Street summer garden believes that he is witnessing a long fight when in reality he only sees six rounds of actual battle. But what matters it to the hobo? He is being entertained. That, to him, is sufficient.\n\nGillespie operates the pictures. It is he that turns the little crank upon which the changes depend. It is he that talks jokingly to the crowd. Not always jokingly, either, for at times some careless patron will get within the focus of the kinetoscope and obscure the scene. Then, in a commanding tone, Gillespie orders the unmannerly patron to be seated, and if he fails to sit down immediately, there is a strong-armed gentleman in the rear of the room whose touch is far more forceful than words. The patron either sits down or leaves the parquet. There is but one alternative.\n\nAfter three rounds have been shown, during which the audience is thrown into a wild state of enthusiasm, the picture machine stops suddenly, and a young man about 20 years old furnishes diversion by singing a song through a megaphone. Just why this megaphone is used will probably puzzle the visitor until he gets a trade secret from Gillespie. The megaphone makes a loud sound, one that can be heard in the street. Nothing appeals so strongly to the hobo as sentimental music. Hearing the notes from within, the man on the street enters the saloon, then the parquet, and the chances are that, once seated, he will remain and in the course of time will buy something.\n\nAdditional interest attaches to the songs because they are illustrated. Gillespie manages the slides, too, and when the final chorus is rendered, the words are thrown upon the canvas, and the audience joins in the finale, thereby assisting the singer. This makes more noise, even, than the megaphone effect, and as a consequence, a greater number are induced to enter.\n\nAfter the song, the fight pictures are renewed. Gillespie repeats the rounds that were shown, and after the exhilarating effect of the song, the hobos enjoy the fight even more than they did formerly. A second diversion is the performance of the contortionist. The contortionist is a hobo. He was engaged that morning. He arrived in town without money. He needed some, and negotiations between him and the proprietor of the Champion's Rest were quickly brought to a close. Although the hobo realizes that a theater or a park job would be better, still he is devoted to his art, and he likes applause. Like all actors of high and low degree, he likes a \"hand.\"\n\nThe knockout round is finally shown about 11 o'clock. Ere that time has arrived, the hoboes have spent as much as their means will allow, and enthusiasm in the Champion's Rest runs high. By midnight, things have quieted a bit, and by 1 o'clock, many have departed, while others remain in their chairs. A hobo is always welcome to a chair in the Champion's Rest. He may not have room rent, and if he has not, he always knows that a chair in the parquet is at his disposal, even if he has no money.\n\nThe wise proprietor knows that the hobo may have money on the morrow, and if he has, he will spend it with the man who has befriended him. This is a characteristic of the tramp element. On some nights, trade in the Champion's Rest is good until 2 o'clock, but as a rule, most of the hoboes are asleep at this hour, and during the remaining hours of the night, the porter keeps a silent vigil.\n\nProtection is afforded all patrons, and the man who sleeps in a chair feels reasonably assured that no one will steal his hat while he slumbers, although there are frequenters who will do it if the opportunity presents itself. There are hoboes, too, who will rob their fellow-hobo. If the sleeping hobo has a dime in his pocket, he may wake up without it if the porter has proved derelict in his duty."

King and his trainer, Con Reardon, were on hand. Hickey was not there. As we learned, he had been in town all the afternoon and through the advice of his trainer he went home before the meeting. The next deposit of $200 a side, which is the last, will be made on the 15th of June at the house of Mike Williams, the Cabinet saloon, corner Ottawa and Walnut streets. Both the backers and the men will be present when the partisans of the men can judge for themselves of the condition of their men. On the 12th of June King and his trainer, Con Reardon, will have a joint benefit. The occasion will be an interesting one with plenty of sparring and variety accompaniments.\n\nAt a called meeting of the Jackson B. B. C. on Tuesday evening, which was called to make a permanent organization, there were nine additional names added to the former list. All members of the said club are requested to be on the ground next Sunday at 2 o'clock sharp for preliminary practice and other business. We desire to have a full attendance as the Jackson must be a No. 1 club. The club will meet next Tuesday evening at the Merchants’ exchange, Main street between Court and Ross, at 8 o'clock to transact business of importance. By order of John I. Shea, president, and T. B. McLean, secretary.\n\nWe were over to Harlem yesterday and made a visit to the training quarters of Jim King, and he says he wishes the time was a little shorter for his fight with Hickey, as he feels confident of vanquishing his man. He feels full of spirits, jumping fences, running, walking, etc., and is just as lively as a deer. When he first commenced training he weighed 155 pounds, and he now is reduced to 132 pounds. In fact, he is nothing else but bones and muscles, and his weight the day of the fight, the 21st of June, will be 125 pounds. He would advise Hickey to look to himself, as King intends to give him the hottest job he ever had in the profession. King wishes us to notify the public that he and Con Reardon will have a benefit next Saturday night, when he hopes his friends will rally around him.\n\nOn next Friday evening a meeting of the Jackson baseball club will be held at the Merchants’ exchange for the transaction of business. The meeting of last Tuesday was postponed on account of the weather. We hope to have a full attendance next Friday night. By order of John Shea, president, and T. B. McLean, secretary.\n\nThe backers of King and Hickey, the public and the whole of the sporting fraternity, are hereby notified that the final deposit of $200 a side for the match on the 21st of June will be put down at 8 o'clock, at the Cabinet saloon, when it is expected that both men will be present with their backers; and we also expect that there will be several noted members of the P. R. on hand. Charley Gallagher, who lately beat Tom Allen, Tom Kelly of Bradford, England, and many others too numerous to mention.\n\nArrangements have been made by Hickey and King for the great fight to take place on next Monday the 21st. It is to be hoped that no such disgraceful scenes as were enacted at the fight between Allen and McCoole will be tolerated for a moment at the contest in prospect. Those who desire to see the match fought out must please be in Harlem early Monday morning. A special train will start from one of the depots there, but which depot we could not learn, as a little secrecy was deemed best on this point. The necessary information can be learned in Harlem the morning designated; and to those who intend to go we would say for their guidance that if they will be in Harlem early in the morning they can soon ascertain all they wish to know in regard to the route and the probable place of meeting. Our own impression is that the excursionists will take the special train, run down the road ten or twelve miles, get out at some convenient place, pitch stakes, form the ring, and have the fight over in short order. We understand that a large party is coming from St. Louis and some from Chicago. Tickets for the trip will be sold at the Pennsylvania house for three dollars.",
    summary: "In 1860, tensions rise as Hickey and King prepare for their prize fight in Harlem, echoing the era's pugilistic fervor. Concurrently, baseball gains momentum with organized club meetings."

    text: "There has been so much talk and diversity of opinion as to whether I was ever the real champion of the world that I feel it incumbent upon me to produce facts and figures to show that I really earned that title. Frequently I see this question asked in the newspapers and in many cases I see that the sporting editors answer that I never was champion.\n\nTo start with, Dr. Dudley A. Sargent in his \"Life and Reminiscences of a Nineteenth Century Gladiator,\" calls me the champion of the world. England is a part of the world, ergo, according to Dr. Sargent, who is an authority, I was champion of England. Let us begin at the start. Tom Fig was considered the first champion of England. He bloomed in 1719. The next champion of note was Tom Cribb, who received a championship belt that was not transferable in 1819. The next champion was Tom Spring, who was cock of the walk in 1820. Then comes Jim Ward, who appeared five years later. In 1841 Caunt defeated Nick Ward for a belt that was subscribed for. Four years later Bendigo beat Caunt and got the belt. In 1850 Perry, the Tipton Slasher, after his draw with Paddock, claimed the championship but never defeated the then champion, Bendigo. In 1853 Perry again claimed office because Harry Broome forfeited a match with him. Four years later, Tom Sayers beat Perry for a new belt and $200 a side.\n\nWhen Heenan and Sayers were in the ring an American put the heel of an old shoe into Heenan's hand, saying, \"This is the heel of Yankee Sullivan's shoe, Jack; he swore he never lost a fight while it was in the ring. Leave it there and go in and lick England!\"\n\nAlthough the heel did not prove strong enough to get for Heenan the English championship belt, it must have discouraged Sayers, for he left the belt open for competition. This was the time when Jem Mace won it, conquering the giant, Sam Hurst, known as the \"Staleybridge Infant.\" Tom Sayers and Heenan fought their memorable battle in 1860. Chamber's Encyclopedia under the head of boxing or pugilism, has this to say of the Heenan-Sayers fight: \"The year 1860, however, witnessed a strange revival of the pugilistic sport on occasion of a fight between Tom Sayers, the champion prizefighter of England, and John Heenan, the Benicia Boy, an American, for £200 a side, and the belt, a badge of honor won by the champion. The battle, which was elevated to the dignity of a great international contest by sporting papers, took place at Farnborough, April 17, 1860. It lasted for more than two hours, in which time the American was beaten almost blind and the Englishman dreadfully bruised. The continuance of the battle was prevented by the breaking in of the ring, caused by the interference of the police.\"\n\nAfter the battle, the English champion was ranked by many newspapers, not sporting ones, with the heroes of the Crimea and of Lucknow. Hundreds, if indeed not thousands, of pounds were subscribed for him in admiration of his bravery by persons of all conditions of life and residing in all parts of the country, and he was feted by merchants on the London and Liverpool exchanges. His opponent received equally flattering and substantial testimonials from Americans. The fight formed the subject of discussion in the House of Commons, in which the Home Secretary announced that not only the principals but all present at the spectacle were amenable to the law. Though no steps were taken to bring the offenders to justice, it was intimated to those chiefly concerned that if a renewal of the fight were attempted the law should be put in force against those aiding and abetting it.\n\nHere is one American account of the fight: \"April 17, 1860, John Heenan fought Tom Sayers in England. Battle was for £200 and the championship of England and America. Friends of Sayers, seeing the condition of their champion and fearing he would lose, cut the ropes and the battle ended in a wrangle. The stakes were drawn and each pugilist was presented with a championship belt. The belt given to Heenan had not been paid for, and he was obliged to return it.\"\n\nIn 1861 Jem Mace beat Hurst. In 1863 Tom King beat Mace and claimed the belt, which he subsequently gave up, declining again to meet the Gypsy. Mace again claimed the belt. In 1866 Jem Mace and Joe Goss fought a draw for $1000 a side and the belt. In 1869 McCoole beat Tom Allen in this country for the championship of the world. In 1870 Jem Mace drew with Joe Coburn here for the championship of the world. In 1870 Jem Mace and Tom Allen fought for the title and $5000 at Kenner, New Orleans. Mace won.\n\nTom Allen beat McCoole on Sept. 23, 1873, at Chouteau Island, near St. Louis, and on Nov. 18, same year, Ben Hogan fought Tom Allen for $200 and the championship of the Pacific coast. Allen was winning when a wrangle broke up the fight. On Sept. 7, 1876, Joe Goss fought Allen for $2000 and the championship of the world in Kentucky. Goss was declared winner. The latter was brought over from England by Jem Mace. On May 20, 1880, Joe Goss fought Paddy Ryan for $1600 and the championship, at Collier Station, W. Va. and after one hour and twenty-seven minutes of hard fighting Ryan won.\n\nIn commenting on the fight the Kansas City Times said: \"Sullivan knocked Joe Goss out in four and one-half minutes on Feb. 7, 1880, while it took Ryan one hour and 27 minutes to do the same thing to the foreign champion.\"\n\nMy victory over Slade of Australia (the Maori) brought here by Jem Mace, is a matter of history, as is the slaughter of Charley Mitchell in Madison Square Garden, when I begged Capt. Thorn to let me get one more crack at him. This was when Charley's seconds had propped him up against the ropes after the police interfered during the third round. Turning to Mitchell, Capt. Thorn said: \"Go to your dressing room. I stepped in to save Sullivan from killing you.\"\n\nAlf Greenfield was brought from England in 1884 to defeat me. He was sent over as Albion's champion. On Nov. 17, that year, in Madison Square Garden, I had Alf in a semi-conscious state on the ropes and all hands (principals and seconds) were arrested. Charley Johnson awarded the decision to me.\n\nGreenfield again met me. This time in New England Institute, Boston. M. Keyes of San Francisco refereed. This was on Jan. 12, 1885. When Greenfield came back to life after the fourth round and he was asked if I could hit hard, he turned to Jack Burke and said: \"Sullivan could beat you, Mitchell and myself, in the same ring.\"\n\nI guess that came pretty near making me the champion of the world.\n\nAs a further proof I would like to reproduce the challenge that I issued after I had arrived in Boston immediately following my defeating Paddy Ryan for the championship:\n\n\"There has been so much newspaper talk from parties who claim that they are desirous of meeting me in the ring that I am disgusted. Nevertheless, I am willing to fight any man in this country in four weeks from signing articles for $5000 a side, or any man in the old country for the same amount at two months from signing articles, I to use gloves, and he, if he pleases, to fight with bare knuckles, as I do not wish to put myself in a position amenable to the law. My money is always ready, so I want these fellows to put up or shut up.\"",

Edward Card, superintendent of the St. Louis City Mission, charges that local divekeepers are having the lives of some of their \"bum\" customers insured, and then feeding them on vile whisky on credit until death pays the toll, when the divekeepers collect the insurance policies.\n\nThe liquor used in this horrible game of \"policy,\" dealing in human lives in St. Louis, is not legally made whisky, but stuff concocted of deadly drugs in the cellar of the dives and fed to the crazed creatures whose wretched lives are insured by the operators, the missionary alleges.\n\nWhen the game begins, the saloonkeeper spends a lump sum to \"brace up\" the social outcast to pass an examination. Then he hies him off to the \"den,\" gorges him with drugged whisky free, and makes him sleep on the premises.\n\nThe game closes when the victim dies in misery and the player cashes in from the insurance company.\n\n\"There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\" And there are more things going on in St. Louis than is ever dreamed of in the philosophy of St. Louisans.\n\nThis has been forcibly brought to mind by reports of certain divekeepers who are charged with insuring the lives of wayward men and then giving them bad whisky. This terrible game, which has a thousand devious branches, is commonly referred to as \"Death's Policy Game.\" It is played in the low saloons and resorts of the city where depraved men congregate. It is not exactly a new game, but it's a more widespread practice now than ever. Mission workers of St. Louis declare this practice to be one of the most serious and deadly barriers to the uplifting of the fallen drug victims and social outcasts of the city.\n\nConsider, if you can, a resort where men who have once been fathers, husbands, able and diligent workers, are brought to sleeping in a room which might have been an illustration from Dante's Inferno. The ceilings are low and smutty. Around the room are hung signs which are sacrilegious, threatening to moral, mental, and spiritual welfare of all who read them, where the air is so foul as to stifle the stranger entering the doors. Around this foul room asleep on benches are men of all ages, unkempt, ragged, neglected, homeless, and hardened by liquor. There are men with white hair, young men, men of middle age who are not yet too far gone in the throes of hell to regain their place in life. Dim oil lamps throw a weird light over the scene of horrors. The uneven respiration of the hundred sleepers reaches the ear, and now and then a miserable sufferer turns in his sleep and utters a groan of agony.\n\nThe guardian of this gang is not a shining-faced, friendly host such as are found in first-class fast saloons where a wanderer can get a clean bed for 10 cents. Rather he is a man with a red face, a bloated cheek, and a curse for his patrons who get in his way.\n\nHe has his own philosophy and he will pound his fist on a table, declaring that he makes it his business to \"get all out of the gang that he can.\" And he keeps his word.\n\nFew St. Louisans do not remember the gang known as the \"Heinegabubblers.\" This name was coined after the organization of a series of saloons in various parts of the city by a man who came to St. Louis from the West. This man, by his strange personality, always had a following of idle men to whom he gave and sold bad whisky and liquors. But the saloons he operated were different from the ordinary saloon. They were kept in neglected sheds and basements, were of the vilest kind, and the army of \"Heinegabubblers\" drank, ate, and slept on the floors and tables.\n\nThe \"Heinegabubbler\" saloons were equipped with trapdoors, sliding stairways, chairs with legs broken, and all sorts of contrivances which were installed for the amusement of the guests of the resort and to be used in case of a raid by the police.\n\nIt was known that the \"Heinegabubblers\" were consumers of the vilest concoctions of the bad whisky men. It was proven that more than one degenerate was the subject of an insurance policy, the beneficiary of which was the man who made and dispensed the liquor he drank.\n\nHeinegabubblers held their carousals in St. Louis for many years. Finally, they were all closed up and the man who ran them disappeared. They were the very worst dives St. Louis has ever known.\n\nTom Allen's saloon at Seventh and Market streets, where the American Theater now stands, was another place that dragged scores of men to the gutter through the medium of \"doped\" liquor. In those days, saloons remained open all night and the men slept in the barroom, huddled on chairs, benches, and on the floor. Tom Allen's saloon consisted of one big barroom in a tumble-down frame building over which the proprietor lived. The walls were decorated with signs of both a sacrilegious and immoral character. On the front window was posted this significant sign, \"We are lower than the lowest.\"\n\nIn the dingy room of Tom Allen's joint, as many as 200 men slept on cold nights. These men ranged from 18 to 65 years of age. Some of them were men who had fallen into the clutches of the saloonkeeper at an early age.\n\nThe story of a man by the name of Knight illustrates this. Knight was arrested for a minor offense by the St. Louis police in the heyday of Tom Allen's activities. He told a story that sent a chill of horror over the city. People did not know such things existed outside of fiction.\n\nKnight said that he staggered into a certain dive and asked for a drink. He was about 50 years old at this time, had been a drinking man for twenty years, and he was then in a state of almost starvation. The saloonkeeper looked him over, sized him up, and said:\n\n\"I think I'll take a chance on you. I'll give you $100 cash, all the whisky you can drink, and a place to sleep if you let me take out an insurance policy on your life.\"\n\nKnight acceded and after sobering up, he was insured for $1,400. He was then fed on bad whisky for months. As fast as he got sober, the saloonkeeper passed more liquor over to him. This was kept up until he almost died from the effects of the drugs. Knight finally left the saloonkeeper, sobered up, and \"got on his feet\" again. The latter lost the $100 cash and the whisky. But there are hundreds of these men who do not rise like Knight did.\n\nThere are said to be as many of these dives in St. Louis today as there have ever been in the past.\n\nOne local organization which now openly advertises its rotten product operates six or seven saloons in the city. Its patrons number 1,000 men, 50 percent of whom have one foot in the grave. It is declared by certain mission workers of St. Louis that they know of several actual cases where saloon people are giving whisky away free to the men who frequent their resorts. This is said to be convincing that these same saloonkeepers must find some profit in return for their beneficence. One man recently informed Rev. Edward Card of the St. Louis City Mission that he positively knew that a certain St. Louis saloonkeeper holds a policy on his life for $1,500. He gets his whisky free from this man.\n\nThis whisky may be left to the imagination of the reader. Each mixer is said to have his own formulas, which he keeps secret. These are deadly more or less, according to the nerve of the man who mixes them.\n\nA case recently exposed brought to light the fact that this so-called \"bad liquor\" seldom contains more than 10 percent real whisky. Another quantity secured by a St. Louis man showed enough cocaine to almost kill a man who drinks it. Others have been found to contain morphine, strychnine."

    text: "“Tom Allen, who for years was a resident of St. Louis, was one of the greatest fighters the world has ever known,” reminisced Prof. Bill Clark, yesterday, while we were speaking of famous fights.\n\n“Allen's battle for $10,000 and the championship of the world with Jem Mace, England's great fighter, was a ferocious one. The men signed to mix, January 17, 1870. They met on May 10, following, within ten miles of the city of New Orleans. Of course, this battle was fought under the London Prize Ring Rules on the turf, which permitted hugging and wrestling, the bare knuckles being used.\n\n“On the afternoon of May 9, 1870, the St. Charles Hotel in the Crescent City was crowded with sportsmen from all parts of America, who had come to see the great battle. Betting was fast and furious till Allen's backers stood out for such long odds that the other side refused to give. Both heroes were present, and each was the center of an admiring crowd. Mace was accompanied by his cousin, Pooley Mace, and his trainer, Jem Cusick, who had trained and seconded John C. Heenan, the “Benecia Boy,” for his great fight with Tom Sayers, the English champion, years before.\n\n“Jem had commenced his training at Mobile Bay, but, to escape the attentions of the sheriff, he had moved to Magnolia, in Alabama, and had finally taken his breathings on the old Metairie race track, on the outskirts of New Orleans, the scene of the great contest between those two mighty heroes of the turf, Lexington and Lecompte, whose rivalry was as famous as that between Hermis and Colonial Girl, World's Fair year. It was at that old track that Lexington performed his memorable feat of covering four miles in 7 minutes and 19 seconds.\n\n“Everyone was full of praise of Jem’s condition,” rambled on grand old Bill. “At the St. Charles Hotel, beautiful Creole girls and handsome white women pressed forward, eager to be introduced to the good-looking Englishman, and they kept poor Jem’s heart in a flutter, as he told me afterwards. Jem never in his life had such an enthusiastic reception, and he commented on the warmth of sympathy and geniality of the Southerners.\n\n“Tom Allen attracted comparatively little attention. It was Mace, the most scientific boxer in the world; Mace, the hero of a score of fights; Mace, the champion of Great Britain, that men and women were eager to see and to shake hands with. Allen, who had trained right here in St. Louis, under Jack Goulding and Joe Coburn, had of course plenty of attention from his backers, and the ladies condescended just to cast one curious glance at him to hundreds for the champion.\n\n“It was a case of early to bed that night for all of us, for the start for the ground was to take place from the Jackson Railway depot at 4 o'clock the next morning; and, as a matter of fact, many prominent citizens, merchants, lawyers, physicians, ex-officers of both the Federal and Confederate armies, from the grade of general down to lieutenant, were at the rendezvous by 3:30 a.m., though it was 5 o'clock before the specially-chartered train moved out of the station.\n\n“The municipal authorities would not allow the fight to take place anywhere within their immediate jurisdiction, but they dispatched seventy policemen to see the special safe out of the station. The train was halted about a quarter of a mile from the depot, and then boarded by the police, who ejected every person who was unable to produce a ticket, and thus the rowdy element was effectually excluded. The combatants and their seconds were not in the special itself, but followed behind in what was then called a “dummy”—that is a locomotive and passenger car combined in one, the former being fitted with condensing engines to avoid the noise of escaping steam.\n\n“About eight miles from New Orleans, at a place called Kennerville, the train disgorged its freight. The twenty-four foot ring was quickly set up, and the spectators, some 1,000 or 1,500 in number, quietly ranged themselves round it. A more orderly crowd never assembled to witness a prize-fight, which was no doubt due to the fact that quite three-fourths of those present were what the Crescent City papers called “men of culture.” The Chicago Baseball Club had come en masse to see the sport and there were few sporting societies in America and even Canada which were not represented.\n\n“The Louisiana Jockey Club, which had its headquarters in New Orleans, had turned out in full strength to do honor to the occasion, and not since the great fight between Heenan and Sayers, had such an assembly graced the ringside. The men were of all nationalities there; Creole dandies, glossy-coated and patent-leather booted; broad-shouldered planters, in suits of white nankeen; smartly-togged sports from New York; backwoodsmen in homespun—any variety of costumes in fact.\n\n“Loud cheers greeted both men as they stepped on the smooth greensward, attended by their seconds, Jem Cusick and Pooley Mace for the Englishman; Joe Coburn, whom I boxed at the Natatorium twenty years ago, and Thurston for Tom Allen. There had been a good deal of shaking of the head among us old-timers, who believed in the old adage, “Youth will be served,” at Mace's rashness in taking on a man so much younger than himself. For Allen was but 27, and thirteen years is a lot to give away.\n\n“But they forgot that Jem Mace had been notoriously careful of himself. Indeed, I don't know of any pugilist with maybe the exception of Jem Ward, who took better care of himself than Jem Mace, and, like Ward, he, in consequence, preserved his health and vigor in a surprising manner. Jem’s condition that day was perfect.\n\n“He was as hard as nails, though he scaled 168 pounds, which was ten pounds more than his fighting weight in England. You may think that was light for a heavyweight, but I have always maintained that a 165-pound man is not handicapped against the heaviest fighter in the world, if the 165-pounder has courage, skill and strength. We have instances that support my theory in Mace, Mitchell, Fitzsimmons and McCoy. Any of these men would have beaten to death the man Jack Johnson won from at Reno, July 4, 1910.\n\n“Tom Allen, that notable May day weighed 175 pounds. He appeared ruddy and well, but there was too much flesh about his face. My recollection of Tom is that he was rather light and thin about the shoulders and back that day, but with good loins and first-rate pedestals. He was not as muscular or well-built as the champion, but he had the advantage of an inch in height. Mace, though much the older man, moved with all the suppleness of a panther, and was clearly the more agile of the two.",

    text: "The writer was a guest of Professor Bill Clark, the Belfast Chicken, Sunday afternoon. It had occurred to me that it would prove interesting reading St. Patrick's Day if I could present to the readers of The New Star an authentic story of how the world's ring championship came to America. I had never seen such an article and knew that the beloved “Belfast Chicken” could tell me. In fact, I believe he is the only man in the world today who is acquainted with the true story of the retrogression of the British fighters and the rise of Americans.\n\nHere is old Bill's story, which I report as accurately as it is possible for me to do. “The Chicken” talked in this manner:\n\n“That grand old institution, the prize ring, which has an ineradicable charm for all men, attained the height of its popularity in the year 1860, when that gallant little champion, Tom Sayers, after a struggle with John Camel Heenan, the American champion, which may be truly described as stupendous, retired from active work, and left the old Champion Belt open for competition. The troubles of the prize ring then commenced. In turn, the trophy was won by Sam Hurst, the giant from Stalybridge, Jem Mace, Tom King, Joe Wormald, Mace again, and finally, after a number of scenes not of a very creditable nature, the police made matters so hot that a number of prominent pugilists determined to try their luck in America. Just prior to their departure, however, Joe Goss, the English champion, and Tom Allen signed articles to fight for the premier honor.\n\n“That intended battle really put an end to the sport in England, for both men were arrested on the eve of the fight upon bench warrants, and from the activity and earnestness shown in the matter the pugilists realized that it was all over with their vocation for a time.\n\nOFF TO AMERICA.\n\n“Among the foremost arrivals in the land of the Stars and Stripes were Joe Wormald, O'Baldwin, Bob Prettle, Bill Ryall, Jem Mace, Joe Goss, and Tom Allen. Only the doings of the two last-named, however, need claim our present attention. At that time (1867) Tom Allen was at his very best, and was a splendid specimen of an athlete, fully 5 feet 10 inches, and about 164 pounds. He could hold his own in any company, and soon after his arrival in America he made a match with Mike McCoole, a man almost big enough to eat him, and he was fast making mincemeat of Michael when the latter's friends opened on him with ball cartridge, and stopped proceedings. At that time ring fights were conducted on very free and easy lines in America, pistols and knives playing a very prominent and lively part in the proceedings, while in some of the encounters the men themselves fought on the “all in\" principle, and half the battle was frequently fought with both men on the ground.\n\nBARKERS AND BOWIES.\n\n“With the introduction of the British brigade, however, things mended somewhat, and when, after the departure of Mace and Co., Goss and Tom Allen were once more matched for the championship—not of England, bear in mind, but for that of the world this time—a fairly decent display was given. The men, of course, fought under the recognized London Prize Ring Rules, and all would have gone well but for a gang of ruffians who had backed Goss somewhat heavily, and when the latter was seen to be getting the worst of it they presented a few barkers and bowies to the notice of the referee, and that worthy was induced to give his decision in favor of the man who would in all probability have lost if the fight had been allowed to proceed.\n\nPADDY RYAN.\n\n“While the British brigade were reaping a golden harvest by fighting among themselves and giving exhibitions of the noble art, there arose a young Irish-American from the city of Troy, who laid claim to the title of champion. He fought and defeated a number of local men, and challenged Joe Goss to fight for the championship. There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm over the event; in fact, so much was made of it that the Attorney-General of Ontario, where the fight was advertised to take place, ordered out three companies of the Third Battalion of Infantry to arrest the disturbers of the peace. As a consequence, the meeting between the men had to be postponed, and finally, after being hunted about from place to place, the men fought on the border line between West Virginia and Pennsylvania, where a terrific encounter was put up. However, Ryan, the younger and stronger man, eventually compelled his antagonist to give in, after fighting nearly an hour and a half.\n\nTHE GENESIS OF GLOVE FIGHTING.\n\n“After the Goss and Ryan battle, the authorities bestirred themselves, and issued a warrant for the arrest of both men, but they managed to escape to Canada, where they had to hide until the matter was settled. The legal business was rather a lengthy job, and by the time it was finished and Ryan had returned to New York he found that a new star had come to the front. This was a young Bostonian, John Lawrence Sullivan by name, who had been creating quite a sensation by the marvelous manner in which he put his opponents to sleep with the gloves. Sullivan challenged Ryan to fight with these weapons, but the latter replied that as he had won the championship from Goss by a fight with nature's weapons the Boston glove-slinger would have to meet him under like conditions. A tremendous amount of time was wasted in discussing the terms of the meeting, but at length Sullivan had to give way, and the pair signed articles to fight under London Prize Ring Rules for the championship of the world and $5,000 a side.\n\nSULLIVAN WINS THE CHAMPIONSHIP.\n\n“The men met at Mississippi City on February 7, 1882, and a truly hurricane fight was put up. From the first round it was practically “all over,” for Ryan was helpless in the hands of the sturdy Bostonian. Sullivan simply overwhelmed and outpunched his plucky opponent, and eventually won the fight with ridiculous ease in the short time of eleven and a half minutes. And that is how the championship went to America.\n\n“Mace who had the best right to the English title had drawn with Joe Coburn. Goss beat Coburn. Goss also drew with Mace. There was no doubt whatever that Goss was esteemed the best man in Great Britain.\n\n“England has tried many times to wrest back the championship under London Prize Ring and Marquis of Queensberry rules, but has never been able to do so.\n\n“Charley Mitchell made the best attempt of all the contenders when he fought Sullivan thirty-nine rounds to a draw decision on the estate of the Baron Rothschilds at Chantilly, France. But the English champion ran away from Sullivan all through the fight. A draw was his aim and he got it.\n\n“Even then, Sullivan was slipping back. He had been feted and dined in England like a god. Jack Ashton and Sullivan sparred before the Prince of Wales and Sullivan met the queen at a special reception.\n\n“At 24, the ring never saw the like of Sullivan,” concluded the Professor, “he would have beaten men like Johnson in a punch.”",
    summary: "In the 1860s, British pugilists Tom Allen, Mike McCoole, and Jem Mace moved to America, aiding the rise of fighters like Irish-American Paddy Ryan, who won a U.S. championship."

    text: "James J. Corbett is writing on \"John L. As I Knew Him.\" It relates many heretofore unpublished incidents in the life of the great warrior.\n\nLong about the 50th round, the hands of both men were in fearful condition. But they fought on. And it became obvious that the superior condition of Sullivan would be the deciding factor. He was weary in arms, in legs, and in body but Kilrain was more so.\n\nKilrain decided to play the \"stall\" game through the fifties and sixties. So round after round he came from his corner, got within striking distance of Sullivan, and then went down before John L. could hit him solidly. Under the rules, every knockdown constituted a round. Immediately after each feigned knockdown, Kilrain would go to his corner and rest for thirty seconds as the rules provided. Then he would repeat the performance in the next round.\n\nAlong about the seventy-first round, Kilrain's condition, due to the beating which Sullivan had given him and made worse by the fearful heat, became pitiful. Even the \"stalling\" had not helped him much. At the end of the seventy-fifth round, Kilrain, almost at the point of exhaustion, had to be carried to his corner and supported in his chair and the end was in sight.\n\nWith the clang of the gong for the seventy-sixth round, Sullivan came from his corner and toed \"scratch\" but the backers of Kilrain took a final look at their man and tossed in the sponge. It was the token of Kilrain's defeat and John L.'s victory in the last bare-knuckle championship fight in the United States. And, when all is said and done, that triumph over Kilrain stands out as perhaps the greatest in the entire career of the great champion.\n\nAs John L. Sullivan ever the heavyweight champion of the world? A hundred thousand times—and more—this question has been asked. Some persons have answered \"Yes,\" and just as many have replied in the negative. But in my opinion, backed by facts, John L. Sullivan was the heavyweight champion of the world under London Prize Ring rules—and he never lost that title.\n\nThe first real champion in pugilism was James Figg, an Englishman, who reigned back in 1719. From that time on for more than a century, the tracing of the championship is rather difficult. But in 1858 one finds Tom Sayers ranked as the heavyweight champion of England and John C. Heenan, \"The Benicia Boy,\" the outstanding warrior of the American prize ring. On April 17, 1860, Sayers and Heenan met in England in a battle for a $1,000 side bet and the \"heavyweight championship of the world.\" After a battle of forty-two rounds, which occupied two hours and twenty minutes, toughs broke into the ring and stopped the fight. The referee could do nothing but call the fight a draw. Almost immediately after that battle, Sayers retired from the ring and Heenan claimed the heavyweight championship of the world, and his claim was generally recognized.\n\nLate in 1860, Sam Hurst of England whipped Tom Paddock, a fellow Briton, and a belt, emblematic of the heavyweight championship, was awarded to him. On January 15, 1861, Jem Mace defeated Hurst and in turn became the champion. On November 26, 1862, Tom King whipped Mace in twenty-one rounds and established rights to the heavyweight championship of England. On December 10, 1863, King clinched claim to the title by defeating Hurst in twenty-four rounds. A short while afterward King retired from the ring. Joe Wormald laid claim to the title. So did Mace. When Wormald retired temporarily from the fighting world, due to an injured hand, Mace was recognized as the champion. In 1866, Mace, in defending the championship, fought a draw with Joe Goss. A year or so later Tom Allen of England came to the front and after vainly challenging Mace, claimed the British heavyweight title, but Mace retained the belt. Then Allen came to the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, various battles on American soil between American fighters established Mike McCoole at the top of the fighters in the United States. In 1869, Allen and McCoole fought in St. Louis for \"the heavyweight championship of the world.\" McCoole won in the ninth round on a foul but Allen refused to concede McCoole's claims to the championship of the world.",

    text: "Shortly afterward, Mace came to the United States and sought a battle with Allen. He was accommodated. The two Britons met in Kennersville, Ind., on May 10, 1870, and Mace won in 10 rounds. At once, Mace declared himself heavyweight champion of the world, although McCoole, by virtue of his earlier victory over Allen, had a better claim.\n\nMace became inactive as a ring performer around 1873, and then Allen and McCoole decided to fight again to determine \"the real heavyweight champion of the world.\" They met in St. Louis on September 22, 1873, and Allen, the Englishman, won in seven rounds. The public then recognized Allen as the king of heavies.\n\nOn May 7, 1876, Allen fought Joe Goss, and after one hour and fifty-two minutes of furious fighting, Goss won—and the crown was passed along to him. On May 30, 1880, Goss fought Paddy Ryan in Collier Station, West Virginia. The men battled for 87 rounds—and in the end, Paddy Ryan was the winner.\n\nAnd in 1882, John L. Sullivan came along and knocked out Paddy Ryan! Doesn't that prove Sullivan's right to the heavyweight championship of the world under London Prize Ring rules?\n\nFrom that day in 1882 until he died, no man ever whipped John L. in a fight under London Prize Ring rules. And John L. fought the best men that would face him.\n\nSome persons claim that Sullivan was not the real heavyweight champion because he failed to whip Charlie Mitchell, who, at the time of their second fight, was the outstanding pugilist in Great Britain. But the rules of the prize ring are specific on this point: A champion remains such until beaten!\n\nAnd Charlie Mitchell, although he put up a wonderful fight against John L., did not beat him. The best he could do was to earn a draw. And no King in pugilism can be dethroned by other than a knockout or a referee's adverse decision.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan was the heavyweight champion of the world—the \"champion of champions.\"\n\nThe Sullivan-Kilrain fight in Richburg, Miss., in 1889 sounded the death knell for bare-knuckle fighting. It was indisputably a brutal contest, and even those fans who loved the sight of gore in a prize ring had their desires more than satisfied. And so when public sentiment condemned London prize ring fighting, bare-knuckle fighting was banned.\n\nAfter the Kilrain fight, John L. quit living the \"straight-laced life\" that had been his routine while under the handling of Billy Muldoon. But though the champion took things easy, he was not the reckless spender of his earlier days. Muldoon's lectures had made their impress. John L. had come to realize that his superb physique had its limitations against the attacks of dissipation. And he became fairly moderate in his indulgences.\n\nThe man who had been called \"the greatest spender in America\" came to the realization that his big roll was becoming emaciated. The champion, up to that time, had earned something like $650,000 in the ring and on the stage, but he couldn't have more than $500 left. So he became a little more cautious as to his money, and the occasions of his wild squandering began to grow fewer and fewer.\n\nJohn L. was becoming a wiser man as the years crept on.",

    text: "(Editer's Note: This is the twenty-second chapter of a series of articles which Mr. Corbett is writing on “John L. As I Knew Him,” published incidents in the life of a great warrior. The next installment will appear tomorrow.)\n\nAnd Dempsey’s prediction came true.\n\nThe thought of meeting John L. Sullivan in a battle for the championship never entered my mind until a trifle more than a year before the contest was staged. John L. had no greater admirer than my father. He regarded the mighty Bostonian as an unbeatable warrior. And through all the early part of my career as a boxer, I shared that belief.\n\nOther chapters told how I first saw John L. in San Francisco when I was 17, and, kidlike, trailed him through the streets for hours. That was in 1884. Two years later, I saw him again, and my reverence for him was increased by his quick and decisive victory over Paddy Ryan in the California city.\n\nAnd then John L. went east, leaving me disappointed because I had not been fortunate enough to be among those who shook his hand.\n\nThrough 1886, 1887, and 1888, I worked as few kids ever worked to perfect myself as a boxer. But the idea of becoming champion someday never entered my mind until long afterward.\n\nI knew the road to the championship had to hurdle John L. Like millions of others, I felt that Sullivan couldn’t be beaten. But that didn’t halt me in my efforts to become the best boxer that my ability would permit.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1889, when I whipped Joe Choynski in our hard-fought Benecia Bay barge fight, that I decided to become a champion. Some had declared John L. Sullivan was afraid to meet.\n\nIn January 1890, which was after the Jackson match had been made, I went to New Orleans again. The surface purpose was to witness the Jack Dempsey-Bob Fitzsimmons fight on January 14. But the underlying idea was to give me an excuse to stop over in Chicago where John L. Sullivan was showing at the time.\n\nI had a message for the champion, and I felt the time was ripe to deliver it.",

    text: "A few days after the Jack Dempsey-Bob Fitzsimmons fight, which was in New Orleans on January 14, 1891, I went to Chicago. The morning after my arrival, I sent a messenger boy to the West Side Theater with $15 and a written request for a box seat. John L. Sullivan was appearing at that playhouse in “Honest Hearts and Willing Hands,” and I was anxious to look at the great gladiator once again.\n\nThe boy came back a short time later with my $15, six tickets calling for an entire box, and a note from Jim Wakely, who was associated with John L. at that time in his theatrical tours. The note read:\n\n“Your money is no good at this showhouse, Jim Corbett. Please accept these tickets with the compliments of John L. and the rest of us.”\n\nThat night I went to see the show, but hardly had I been seated when Wakely came to my box, greeted me, and then said:\n\n“The big fellow would like to see you, Jim. Come around to the stage entrance.”\n\nAnd so, with Wakely leading the way, I walked to John L. Sullivan's dressing room. As I entered it, the idol of my early boyhood and the “champion of champions” stepped forward, pushed out his huge hand, smiled, and said:\n\n“And so you're Jim Corbett, eh? Glad to meet you. Sit down.”\n\nAfter more than seven years, my yearning to shake the hand of the mighty John L. was realized.\n\nChat With Champion.\n\nEd Williamson, then the famous Chicago shortstop, was in John L.'s dressing room at the time. John L. introduced me to Williamson with:\n\n“Ed, this is the kid that whipped Jake Kilrain down in New Orleans.”\n\n“Yes,” answered Williamson, “I read about it.”\n\nJohn L. looked me square in the eye and then his glance traveled up and down my frame in an appraising way.\n\n“And you're the kid that's going to fight Peter Jackson, eh?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Well, young fellow, I don't like the idea of you fighting a negro. I have drawn the color line.”\n\n“Somebody's got to fight him,” I answered.\n\nJohn L., silent for a while, asked:\n\n“Do you think you can whip him, young fellow?”\n\n“Yes, I really think I can.”\n\n“Well, I hope so; I certainly wish you luck.”\n\nFrom then on until near the end of the play, John L., Williamson, and I engaged in general conversation that had more to do with baseball and theatricals than with pugilism. Williamson's presence in the dressing room balked me in my plans to deliver my message to John L. there. So I decided to wait until another day.\n\nNear the end of the play, I got up and said to John L.:\n\n“I think I'll be going along now.”\n\nJohn L., in the dominating way that was his, exclaimed:\n\n“You aren't going to do anything of the sort. You're going to stay with me for a while and we'll see the town. Wait for me until I get washed up.”\n\nHitting High Spots.\n\nImmediately after the show, John L. and I jumped into a hack, and John L. proceeded to show me the town. Together we visited a half dozen hotel bars, and in each and every place, the entry of the champion was greeted with joy by the other patrons. In most of the places, those who were there attempted to buy wine for John L., but the champion pushed everyone aside and said:\n\n“Only my money is good in this place.”\n\nAnd then he proceeded to “set up the house.”\n\nWe went from one barroom to another, and as our trip continued, I became more and more amazed at the drinking ability of the champion. He was consuming uncountable glasses of champagne. But his imbibing that night, great as it seemed to me, was only trifling in comparison with the capacity of his earlier years. The liquor that John L. drank that night in Chicago would have put an ordinary man “under the table” in an hour or less. But John L. showed no signs of unsteadiness. The only effect the liquor seemed to have on him was to flush his face, to make his eyes brighter, and to make him more talkative than ever.\n\nJohn L.'s Big Heart.\n\nAt last, we entered the place of Matt Hogan, famous in Chicago in that era as a hangout for high-class sports. A group met John L. there, and the champion took me along with him to one of the rooms where he held a little reception. John L., in the big-hearted way that was his, introduced me to everyone as:\n\n“Boys, this is Jim Corbett, the California Kid, who whipped Jake Kilrain a while ago and is now going out to whip Peter Jackson. And boys,” declared John L. as though the fact was a great bit of news, “this kid doesn't drink anything but seltzer water.”",

    text: "The name of Tom Allen figures conspicuously in ring history of a long gone era. Allen, after a number of years of activity in English rings, came to St. Louis, and for nearly ten years afterward he was something of an \"on-again-off-again\" king of American heavies.\n\nBirmingham, England, was Allen's birthplace. Born in 1840, he battled for the first time in a prize ring against a man named Waggner, in 1861, in Birmingham. The bout was for a side bet of $25 and Allen emerged a victor. That triumph encouraged him to make a match with a fellow named Gould for a stake of $200—and once again Allen won.\n\nThose achievements determined him upon a career as a professional ringman. He sought a bout with Posh Price—and was whipped in fifty-five minutes. That was in 1862. Undiscouraged, Allen fought Bingley Rose in Nottingham, England, for $250, and pounded his way to victory in twenty-nine minutes. On June 21, 1864, he waged his next fight against Bob Smith, a Liverpool negro. Allen got the surprise of his life.\n\nThe Birmingham youngster expected an easy victory. The most he could get Smith to fight for was $50 a side. Figuring that Smith was 'easy money,' Allen bet heavily on himself, with the ringside crowd giving big odds. And Smith whipped Allen in two hours and fifteen minutes of furious fighting.\n\nJack Parkinson fell a victim to Allen's prowess after twenty minutes in their bout early in 1865. Soon afterward Allen coaxed Price, his early conqueror, into giving him a return bout for a side bet of $125. Allen, spurred on by an intense hatred for Price, fought one of the most merciless fights of his lifetime, finally forcing Price to quit in the fourth round, after two hours and five minutes of warfare.\n\nOn June 12, 1866, Allen whipped George Iles, which put him in line for a battle with Joe Goss. The two met for the championship of England on March 5, 1867, for a side bet of $500. After thirty-five rounds—one hour and fifty-two minutes of desperate fighting—the contest was halted and called a draw by the referee.\n\nAllen then made matches with Bill Thorne, Mike Cocklin, and Peter Millard in turn. But these three 'ran out,' electing to forfeit their postings of $250 each rather than fight the warrior from Birmingham. After several ineffectual efforts to get another chance at Goss, and unable to get any of the second raters in England to try conclusions with him, Allen decided, in 1867, to visit the United States.\n\nAllen's first appearance before a prize ring audience in this country was not as a fighter, but as a second—and his conduct created a sensation.\n\nJust about the time that Allen arrived in the United States a match was made between Tom Kelly, an old St. Louis fighter, and Bill Parkinson of Pottsville, Pa. The battle, which was for a side bet of $1,000, was put on in Acquia Creek, Va., and stands out as one of the most deplorable in the early history of the pugilistic game.\n\nThe backers of Kelly figured it would be a great boost for their man to secure Allen to second the Baltimore fighter. Allen consented—and went even farther. He agreed to assist the Baltimore gang financially interested in Kelly, to see to it that Kelly did not lose the fight.\n\nSoon after the fight started and it became apparent that Parkinson was Kelly's master, Allen whipped out a huge revolver, and, pointing it at Wm. E. Harding, a New York sport writer, who officiated as referee, declared:\n\n“If Kelly doesn't win this fight you'll get shot.”\n\nAllen's action was the cue for the Baltimore crowd to flourish guns in an effort to frighten Harding. But the courageous referee, looking squarely at Allen, declared:\n\n“I'll decide this fight strictly on its merits. If you don’t like my way of doing things shoot any time you're ready. And that goes for Kelly's gang of cutthroats out here” and Harding pointed out at the ugly and armed crowd.\n\nHarding's coolness and gameness really cowed the crowd—and Allen too. After a time they put their revolvers back into their pockets. But as the fight went on, it became an absolute certainty that if it wasn't stopped Kelly would be beaten into unconsciousness. In this emergency Kelly's backers appealed to Allen to ‘do something.” There was but one thing to do—and Allen did it.\n\nSignaling to the Kelly crowd to rush the ring, Allen cut the ropes so that the Kellyites could have clear passage. Then Allen jumped into the ring, pushed Parkinson back even before Harding could interfere, grabbed Kelly in his arms and carried Kelly out of the ring. Allen's hope that his action might cause Harding to declare the bout a draw or “no contest” were vain.\n\nHardly had Kelly been carried out of the ring than Harding in a loud voice announced:\n\n“The action of Allen and the Kelly men cutting the ropes and coming into this ring before any decision constitutes a foul and I award the fight to Parkinson.”\n\nStrange to say, none of Kelly's fans attempted to attack Harding. Allen's participation in the affair was given wide publicity and for a long time he was just about as unpopular a pugilist as ever trod American soil. His early efforts to get fights were unavailing, but eventually the prejudice against him died down—and then began Allen's spectacular efforts to gain undisputed claim to the championship of America.",

    text: "BY JAMES J. CORBETT.\n\nTom Allen's first battle on American soil resulted in a forty-three-round victory over Bill Davis, the Californian, on Chouteau Island, St. Louis, January 12, 1869. \"By beating Davis, I have earned the right to claim the championship of America,\" declared Allen, immediately after that battle. \"If any fighter in this country thinks otherwise, I'll give him a battle any time he wants it and for any purse that he names.\"\n\nAllen's seeming arrogance, and also the fact that he claimed the title, even though it seemed legally the property of Mike McCoole, angered many of the American fighters. There was something of a scramble among them to take on the British warrior, but Allen elected to wage his next battle against Charlie Gallagher, the Canadian, who was making his home at that time in Cleveland.\n\nGallagher and Allen battled on Carroll Island, near St. Louis, on February 22, 1869, and Gallagher won in three minutes of fighting by landing a terrific \"pivot\" blow on the jugular of Allen.\n\nOn July 15 of the same year, Allen took on Mike McCoole on Foster's Island, near St. Louis. They fought for a $1,000 side bet. Allen outfought McCoole at every angle, and after nine rounds had been fought, McCoole was thoroughly whipped. But at that moment, McCoole's supporters cut the ropes of the ring—and a wild scene ensued. Clubs of the McCoole gangmen were wielded promiscuously. Shots were fired from glistening revolvers, and a portion of the McCoole mob surrounded the referee and demanded—under penalty of death—that he give the victory to the almost powerless McCoole. Confronted with the alternative of death or deciding in favor of a beaten warrior, the referee took the easiest way out: \"I give this fight to McCoole,\" he announced, and then made his escape.\n\nA few days afterward, Gallagher again challenged Allen, and the contest was fought on Foster's Island on August 17, 1869. Allen battered his rival from one side of the ring to the other for eleven rounds, and Gallagher was in a terrible condition. But once again, Allen was robbed of the fruits of victory. Gallagher's gangmen cut the ropes and dashed at Larry Wessel, who was the referee. They told him they would kill him if he didn’t give the decision to Gallagher. Without hesitation, Wessel declared Gallagher the winner.\n\nA short time afterward, Jem Mace, the great English fighter, arrived in America \"merely on a little pleasure trip.\" However, the boasting challenge issued by Allen—that he could whip any man in the world, Jem Mace included—put Mace on his mettle. So Mace accepted the defi and the two men fought for a side bet of $2,500 and the championship of the world in Kennersville, La., on May 10, 1870.\n\nThat battle brought together as spectators and seconds some of the most famous ringmen in early history. Mace was seconded by Jim Cusick and Jerry Donovan, a brother of Mike Donovan, the middleweight champion, who died a few months ago. Allen had Joe Coburn, former champion, and Sherman Thurston, a famous sportsman of that time, as his seconds, with Dan Ryan serving as his umpire. Al Smith of Chicago, then one of the most famous sportsmen in America, refereed the contest.\n\nAllen, game a warrior as he was, seemed like a novice when pitted against Mace. The latter, one of the most remarkable ringmen of all time, used Allen as a punching bag. His bewildering speed and his remarkable cleverness made it almost impossible for Allen to hit him. Mace pounded Allen when and where he willed. From the first minute of fighting, it was not a question as to whether Mace would win, but how long Allen would last. The finish came for Allen in the tenth round—after forty minutes of fighting."

    text: "Ben Hogan was another pugilist who gained considerable fame and fortune in the long-gone days but has been largely forgotten by ring enthusiasts. His career was a rather unique one, and he stands out as a picturesque figure in ring affairs. \n\nHis real name was Benedict Hagan. He was born in Wurtemberg, Germany, in 1844, of Irish parents, and came to the United States in 1852. He fought his first battle when he was 20. Fearing the wrath of his father, who disapproved of a pugilistic career for his son, Hagan assumed the ring name of Ben Hogan. Hogan, who was 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 190 pounds, won his first battle, which was against Jack Holliday. The fight, which was for a side bet of $400 and involved the settling of an old grudge, lasted seven rounds. A few weeks afterward, Hogan whipped Bob Donnelly in Fort Erie, Canada, in thirty-six rounds.\n\nIn 1867, Hogan fought Charles Collins, known in those days as \"Cast-iron\" Collins, because of his ability to stand up under punishment. The fight, which took place near St. Louis, ended in a fizzle, and the referee called it a draw.\n\nHogan, on a visit to New York, was induced to put on the gloves with Billy Edwards, a well-known lightweight of that era. It was Hogan's first experience with the \"mittens\" and his first real trial against a man who knew much of the scientific end of the game. Surprising as it may seem, the 150-pound Hogan was outpointed throughout by Edwards, whose cleverness impressed Hogan so much that he insisted that Edwards give him boxing lessons.\n\nSome months afterward, Hogan went to Rochester, N.Y., where he appeared in a sparring exhibition with Tom Allen. It was figured Allen would have a walkaway. But Hogan gained the popular verdict, which made his supporters so enthusiastic that they offered to back him for \"any amount\" against Allen, but the latter made a few lucky investments in the oil fields of Pennsylvania and in a trifle more than a year accumulated a fortune of more than $100,000. Undoubtedly, had he remained there, he would have pyramided his money into millions. But the lure of the fight game was too strong.\n\nHogan sold out his oil interests and went back into the ring harness. As the pugilists were about to board the steamer that was to take them to the battleground, which was on the Illinois shore of the Mississippi, they were arrested. Only upon their promise not to fight in Illinois was their release effected. But as soon as they gained their liberty, they entered into a new match under the same conditions, to be fought at Council Bluffs, Iowa.\n\nAllen had all the best of it for three rounds when Hogan claimed that his adversary had struck a foul blow. The Allen gang, angered by Hogan's claim and fearing the referee might grant it, broke into the ring to do violence to Hogan. The latter made his escape, and Referee Eagan declared the fight a draw and returned the money to both pugilists. That battle marked Hogan's last appearance in the ring.\n\nSoon after that contest, Hogan went to New York and for nearly a year indulged in riotous living, during which time he squandered his fortune. Down and out, he was passing along the street when attracted by a crowd of religionists giving an open-air meeting. Hogan paused to listen—and before he left there, he had been converted. At once, he entered enthusiastically into the task of converting sinners and devoted the rest of his life to the good work. And to Hogan's credit, it can be said that he was far more successful as a missionary than he had been as a pugilist.",

Title Only.\n\nBY DAMON RUNYON.\n\nNEW YORK, April 30.—What—again! Is it possible that the ancient argument as to whether John L. Sullivan was ever heavyweight champion of the world is once more before the house? Well, it seems so. And it also seems that I brought it upon my own head by an inadvertent crack recently. I said that James J. Corbett won that title from Sullivan. Whereupon, Mr. Charles F. Mathison, the famous old-time boxing authority, takes typewriter in fist, and harangues me at length. Mr. Mathison has always advanced the claim that James J. Jeffries was America’s first heavyweight champion of the world, and he presents the dope to prove his assertion. He takes the world’s title from all those who went before Jeffries, but he cheerfully awards it to those who followed the old boiler maker, casting no aspersions upon the Crown as it is now dignifiedly worn by Mister Tunney.\n\nMathison’s letter of interest follows:\n\n“Just as it seemed that the question of John L. Sullivan's right to the title of heavyweight champion of the world had been laid to rest, it was suddenly resurrected by your declaration to the effect that Corbett won that honor from the Boston strong boy. If gentleman Jim captured the world’s championship from Sullivan it follows as a matter of course that the Boston strong boy must have had the honor concealed about his person when he entered the ring with Corbett. Unquestionably, Ryan must have been in possession of the Bauble when he faced John L. at Mississippi City in 1882, and as Ryan won the only title he ever held from the aged, but crafty, Joe Goss in 1880, it must be admitted that Goss gained the world's championship from Tom Allen, through the medium of a foul in 1876.\n\n“Unfortunately, for the claimants of a clear descent of the world title from Allen to Goss, to Ryan, to Sullivan, to Corbett, to Fitzsimmons, Jem Mace, heavyweight champion of England, arrived in America in 1869, and was matched with Tom Allen, holder of the American championship.\n\nMace Knocked Out American.\n\n“They met at Kennerville, La., May 10, 1870, in a bout for the world’s heavyweight championship. Mace won by knockout in ten rounds, so that when Allen and Goss met, the title was not at stake. It was that honor that went booming down the centuries until it rested proudly in the heavy fist of John L. Sullivan.\n\n“In enumerating reasons for conferring the world's championship on Sullivan his myriad admirers have placed themselves on record as follows: ‘He licked everybody.’ This also is ruled out for the reason of obvious inaccuracy, as history proves that Sullivan did not ‘lick’ Peter Jackson, Frank Slavin, Joe Goddard, Dominick McCaffrey, Charlie Mitchell, Joe Choynski, Bob Fitzsimmons and several other able fighters who were eager for matches with Sullivan when he was at his best.\n\n“He won the world's title when he defeated Kilrain, the latter having beaten Jem Smith, champion of England.’ Ruled out for the reason that Kilrain did not beat Smith, their bout going 106 rounds to a draw.\n\n“He won the world's title when he beat Paddy Ryan. It is unlikely that if the bout between Sullivan and Paddy Ryan was for the world’s championship the fact would have been omitted in the articles of agreement. This document, which was signed in this city, declares that the battle was for the championship of America.\n\n“Possibly some of the ingenious admirers of Sullivan may be able to adduce some convincing facts as to how the Boston boy captured the elusive world’s championship, and if so the evidence will be studied with interest.\n\nFirst International Battles.\n\n“The first international battles for the world's title were fought in England, John C. Heenan representing America in contests with Tom Sayers and Tom King in the early sixties. Although Heenan beat both Sayers and King, the title was not at stake.”",

A bartender is supposed to have no place in the fight world, probably because of the difficulty of maintaining strict training under such temptations.\n\nHowever, in other days, when saloons were going big in this country, and when fighting was a much more serious matter than it is today, many of the famous fighters owned and operated public houses, while still active in the ring. St. Louis had examples of this, and two world championship battles were fought by St. Louis residents who owned and operated public houses. Mike McCoole and Tom Allen, each of whom held the heavyweight title while residing in this city, were in this class. Later on the Allens, Dalys, and Kellys all owned saloons and fought many famous battles.\n\nNot only did their saloon duties not interfere with their condition, but it may be counted a fact that in many cases these men performed heroic feats of training, their conditioning work lasting over many weeks. In England the fight game is still to some extent centered around “public houses.” But don’t make the mistake of thinking that fighters developed under such auspices are necessarily out of condition."

    text: "Battles of many rounds had left marks. His hands were all but shapeless and his hard face was scarred. On his right hand, there was an especially vicious scar that Tom liked to talk about.\n\n“I got that in my fight with Charley Gallagher,” he said. “It was this way: In the McCool fight on master's Island in June of sixty-nine, there was a draw. McCool’s gang came into the ring and messed things up and the fight was off. Charley Gallagher, who was a young boy, lifted his voice and said that he had come to challenge the title. I yelled back that I was the better man and that I'd accept his challenge and fight him then and there, but the boys said that was too soon and so we fixed it up for Coney Island two months later. The whole town talked of the fight every minute and a great crowd sneaked over in boats to see it.\n\n“You'd not believe it, but fourteen hundred men were there. We sold the liquor privileges and made some money on that, too. The fight had gone four or five rounds when someone fired a shot. The bullet struck the back of my right hand, but it didn’t cut any of the muscles. Dr. Nidelet was there and took the ball out and bandaged the wound, all in a few minutes. Then the referee stood back and we went at it. In the eleventh round, Charley was on the ground and I got the money.”\n\nIn one of his fights, Joe Goss being his opponent, Tom Allen, for a stake of $100, fought thirty-four rounds, at the end of which both men were so exhausted that the referee called it a draw and nobody got a cent.\n\nOne of Tom Allen's pet theories was that old-fashioned prize fighting was cleaner than the gloved methods that followed.\n\nToward the end of Tom Allen's career, there were signs of big money. Someone offered $1,000 a side for a match with Joe Goss, with whom he had fought in England. The battle was to take place over in Kentucky and Allen put up the cash in one bill of a thousand denomination. The Goss people laid down a roll, with a fifty on the outside. When the battle was over and Goss had won, it was found that the roll was a corncob, done up in the fifty. Before personal trouble ensued as a result of this shady proceeding, a sheriff had taken Goss in tow and he spent the next year in jail. Tom Allen, being fleet of foot, got away and managed to reach England. He had acquired, in his fighting career, about $25,000, which he promptly lost in the homeland, after which he came back to St. Louis, missing Kentucky on the way, and he was next heard of in the “Champion's Rest.”\n\n“Here me and me old woman is happy,” he said. “I'm too old to fight and, anyhow, it's a sissy game now. I hev me saloon, me friends, a bit of gab about the old times and that's enough. On cold winter nights I invite the bums in out of the cold and they sleep about the fire. Next mornin’ they clean up for me and I give ‘em breakfast. I've been cold and hungry meself.”",

    text: "The entire sports world extends greetings and felicitations to Maxie Adelbert Baer. He is the new heavyweight boxing champion. Administering a swishing, crushing, two-fisted attack on Primo Carnera, Maxie battered the “Man-Mountain” of Italy into submission in New York last night.\n\nCarnera, whom many boxing critics insisted would never lose his crown, believing the European giant would carry on as king until age caught up with him and forced his retirement, wilted under the power of Baer's fists and chucked it up in the eleventh round.\n\nCarnera, regarded as a bogus champion by unbiased fistic observers, did not go down fighting with his boots on, so to speak. Reeling and staggering around from the effects of Baer's blows, Primo made a weak effort to retain his crown. He allowed Referee Art Donovan to stop the battle. Fighting champions have always gone down offering the last ounce of strength in their bodies. But then, I have always contended that Da Beez Preem was not a fighting champion. He did not fool me when he retired to the field of ex-champions last night.\n\nBaer's victory will serve as a stimulant to the boxing game that was on the verge of a nation-wide close-up. In the first place, Baer is a son of America. He was born at Omaha, Neb, and received many jolts and knocks in his boyhood days. He was a butcher boy, then a kid out of the loose who went sightseeing through life.\n\nWhen Baer entered the boxing profession he donned a dinner jacket. He felt that a boxer could be a gentleman and a showman. He made friends with everyone. He joined the movie colony in California, spent his money at night clubs in New York, and lolled around the beaches of Florida. It was his desire to sit in the front row at all times, mainly because he was going to become the world champion; he wanted to be the idol of the people.\n\nBaer was not going to limit his friends and acquaintances to members of the cauliflower industry that hang around gymnasiums. He was going to meet the folks—say howdy to them and elevate the profession that for the past several years had fallen into bad repute.\n\nWhen I received the final flash last night—“Baer wins!” I wanted to grasp Maxie's right hand and say: “Great stuff, Maxie—you’re the type we need in the sports world—especially in boxing!”\n\nAnd did I join the throng that cheered Baer's victory? I hopped aboard the “I-Told-You” band wagon for in yesterday's forecast I said: “Baer is my choice to win—on a knockout or the decision.”\n\nWhen Baer won from Carnera he closed the reign of bogus heavyweight champions that has existed since Gene Tunney went into retirement. When the ex-mariner stepped out of competition the title became vacant. Through an elimination series of bouts, Max Schmeling emerged on top. The German was awarded the crown on a foul in his bout with Jack Sharkey.\n\nThen Sharkey came up with the honors by gaining the decision over Maxie in fifteen rounds, but his conquest was tainted by Joe Jacobs’ famous outburst—“We've been robbed!” There were many who agreed with Schmeling’s manager that Maxie had received a raw deal when the decision went to Sharkey.\n\nWhen Sharkey and Schmeling were engaging in their series, Carnera, the circus freak of Europe, was imported to look things over in America’s pugilistic harvest. Primo weighed 270 pounds, measured six feet, six and one-half inches in height and wore No. 17 shoes. America, the sucker country for shrewd promoters, fell for Primo’s bulk. He was paraded into rings and ballyhooed as the “man killer.” He knocked over a flock of fistic bums and the build-up to lead him to the championship was on.\n\nCarnera made the grade officially—by knocking out Sharkey in June of last year. Despite his victory over Sharkey, Carnera remained unimpressive in the judgment of many boxing followers.\n\n“Carnera has pasted a bunch of palookas, but what'll he do if he ever meets a boy who is inspired to charge into the big guy and who has no secret strings attached to his fists?” was the question that was heard frequently around the rialto.\n\nThe answer was delivered last night—Maxie Baer, unencumbered, laughed and joked with Primo, even yawned at the Italian's clumsy antics in the ring and brought the heavyweight title back to America where it belongs. Good by Primo, when does the next boat sail for Italy!"

    text: "Fighters of the bare fist and small glove days, when the present 15-round limit was unknown, are shown here. Jake Kilrain, left, fought a 75-round battle with John L. Sullivan, July 8, 1889, in Marion County, Mississippi. Kilrain, now 75 years old, is employed as a night watchman in a shipyard at Quincy, Mass. Center is Harry Sharpe of St. Louis, as he appeared when lightweight champion of Missouri. Sharpe, who went 77 rounds to win the longest match ever fought under Marquis of Queensberry rules, is shown, upper right, as he appears today. In the lower picture Tom Allen, heavyweight champion in the 80's, who died in St. Louis April 5, 1904, is driving. Seated with Allen is “Denver” Ed Smith, heavyweight fighter of Denver, Colo., who was training in St. Louis for his fight with Joe Goddard of Australia. He knocked out Goddard in 18 rounds at New Orleans March 3, 1893.\n\nPrize-fighting in and about St. Louis in the late 80's and the early 90's was popular with the sporting fraternity, but it was neither prominent nor profitable except in rare instances. Matches of any importance were slow in the making and, because they were all fights to a finish, there were long periods of training. In addition, the fighters had either to back themselves or find someone who was willing to risk fortune upon their chances. This was not always easy to do, and when a “backer” was found he invariably insisted that his fighter get in the best possible condition before he would let him fight.\n\nThere was generally considerable wrangling before signing the “articles of agreement,” it being an adage of the ring that “a match well made is half won.” Most of the argument concerned where the men would fight, when, and for how much. It was taken for granted that the fight would be to a finish and there was no trouble coming to an understanding that the fight would be with small gloves, skin-tight gloves, or bare knuckles. These fights were nearly all governed by the Marquis of Queensberry rules, there being only a few fights in the vicinity of St. Louis under the London Prize Ring rules following the defeat of Mike McCoole by Tom Allen in 1873.\n\nThe fight between Allen and McCoole had taken place on Chouteau Island (nicknamed “Bloody” Island by fight followers), in the river a short distance above St. Louis. This fight so outraged the citizens of St. Louis that in the following January the Missouri Legislature passed a statute making prize-fighting a felony and even declared giving an exhibition of boxing in public a misdemeanor.\n\nThis probably accounts for the fact that there was little prize-fighting or boxing in St. Louis from that time until about the middle 80's. It seems to have started again about the time of Tom Allen's return to St. Louis, after having failed to secure a match with John L. Sullivan for the championship of the world.\n\nAllen had returned to London, England, following his victory over McCoole and in the meantime Sullivan came into prominence. Richard K. Fox, publisher of the Police Gazette, a publication given over to sporting and theatrical events, conceived a violent dislike for Sullivan and vowed he would find a man to beat him.\n\nFox sent for Allen and arranged an exhibition with Joe Goss, whom Allen had previously defeated. This exhibition took place in Madison Square Garden in New York City and Allen made such a miserable showing that Fox dismissed the idea of his fighting Sullivan.\n\nAllen came on to St. Louis in 1884 and engaged in the saloon business calling his place the “Champion's Rest.” It was located at the northeast corner of Seventh and Market streets and soon became a popular resort for followers of pugilism. At the other end of the block, Sixth and Market streets, Tom Kelly, a former English middleweight, had his saloon, while around the corner from Allen, at 12 North Seventh street, the Daly brothers—Dan, Charley, and Johnny—were operating their resort. These places were the rendezvous of fighters, and it was not long after Allen and the Daly brothers had established themselves in opposition to Kelly that professional jealousy caused a feud between the three that was not terminated until years afterwards when death settled old scores.\n\nAt this time St. Louis had local fighters who fought each other, but seldom in engagements outside of St. Louis and vicinity. The return of Allen set the pugilistic bee buzzing.\n\nIt began with clashes between boxers, sometimes in rough-and-tumble rings in the back of the places. Most of these fights were of minor importance and for little money, but among the best of the local fighters at this time were Dan, Charley, and Johnny Daly, Ed Kelly, “Dutch” Neil, Harry Allen, “Dynamite” Haley, Hugh McManus, “Rusty” Evans, Benny Evans, Rufus Sharpe (colored), Billy Zachritz, Fred Zachritz, Artie Flint, Josh Dickson, Prof. Paul Pitzlin, Billy McGraw, and George Fitzgerald.",

    text: "Jim Jeffries retired unbeaten, but after nearly eight years' absence from the ring, at the age of 35, he attempted to win back the title \"for the white race\" by facing Jack Johnson. Jeff proved to be just a shell and cracked under the strain.\n\nJack Dempsey made the most gallant effort in history. Under different refereeing conditions he might have been adjudged the victor over Gene Tunney in that memorable Chicago battle. Officially he lost.\n\nIn the bare knuckle days, a champion was credited with regaining the championship of the world—and right here in St. Louis. That was when Tom Allen, the tough Irishman, held the title. The fight was advertised as a championship event, as was their return match, in which Allen was an easy victor. Titles, in those days, were nebulous, however, and Allen had only a thin claim to it. Before leaving England to settle in St. Louis, Allen had fought a 35-round draw with Joe Goss, considered a legitimate championship claimant abroad. He had defeated other good men. It was to Goss that Allen finally lost all claim to the title six years later when, in 1876, they fought in Kentucky, Goss winning on a foul after 29 rounds.\n\nSeveral heavyweights of the past have attempted to remount the throne. James J. Corbett, at the age of 34, and three years after Bob Fitzsimmons had wrested the title from him, missed regaining his title by an eyelash. Although he had fought only once in three years, Corbett made a wonderful showing against Jeffries, having the big \"Grizzly Bear of the Cordilleras\" badly outpointed for 23 rounds. With only two rounds to go, Jeff stopped \"Pompadour Jim.\"\n\nBob Fitzsimmons fought Jeffries a second bout, after having lost his title in 1899, but was crushed more quickly than in their first encounter.\n\nIf there is a possibility that one of two or perhaps three former champions may be given a chance at the title, within a few months. Besides Baer, both Max Schmeling and Primo Carnera are possible opponents of Braddock, the title holder, although it is doubtful if Braddock's manager will consent to let him meet anyone but the winner of the Louis-Baer struggle. The victor in that fight will be the big gate attraction, where Schmeling and Carnera might not draw flies.",

He was still scared later on when he rendered a decision from the stage of a downtown theater. In the return match, Allen took care that he would be protected, and he won back his title. He was then widely recognized. A defeat by Joe Goss later sent Allen to the discard.\n\nSchmeling, who won his title on a foul and then lost it back to the man from whom he had won it, Jack Sharkey, now has an opportunity to become the Tom Allen of modern times. Whether he has the goods remains to be seen. Not many of the professional seers and clairvoyants are practicing their profession this morning. Some of their professional morale was knocked out by the battle of the Yankee Stadium. That goes for us, too.\n\nThere were heard expressions of opinion around the ringside from observers who thought that Louis could have gotten up and continued. It did not seem so to this writer, for Louis was reeling in a daze at times and he had experienced one of the most savage beatings a boxer could endure. Louis was punished much the same as Bob Olin at the hands of John Henry Lewis when battling for the light heavyweight title at St. Louis. If anything, Joe took a worse hammering than Bob.\n\nThere was no doubt of his ability to take punishment. And there is not much doubt that it would have taken a derrick to have brought him to his feet at the count of nine to resume fighting in that fatal twelfth round.\n\nThe Braddock-Schmeling fight of next September is interesting the writers and fight officials. Already speculation is heard as to the probable outcome and whether Schmeling will be the first man of modern fight days to regain a heavyweight championship he had lost.\n\nOne world champion in past history accomplished that feat in the heavy division. He was Tom Allen, an English fighter then making his home in St. Louis. That was in 1873. Four years previously, through rough-house ringside stuff and intimidation, Mike McCoole had got the better of him.",

    text: "It Happened Before.\n\nIf Max Schmeling should defeat Jimmy Braddock in a title bout, would he be the first heavyweight champion to regain a title after having lost it?” asked a ring fan during a recent fight fanfest.\n\nThe almost unanimous answer of those present was “yes.” And, as far as modern fights go, that is to be the case. Actually, one might credit first honors of the sort to the late Tom Allen, proprietor of the old saw-dust floored tavern on Market street near Seventh, known as “Champion’s Rest,” famous throughout the West 40 years ago.\n\nAllen operated that resort up to his death in 1904. It derived its name from the fact that Allen, who was widely recognized as world’s champion after he came from England and settled here in the early sixties, opened and operated the place after his retirement from the ring.\n\nMcCoole Given Biased Verdict.\n\nMike McCoole, another St. Louis tavern keeper and himself a nationally known fighter of the “bruiser” type, challenged Allen for the title and they fought on Chouteau Island in the Mississippi. Allen was winning, but the referee, intimidated by roughs, gave the verdict to McCoole, who claimed the title for four years.\n\nThen they met again in 1873, and Allen cut him to ribbons and made him quit in seven rounds, regaining his title rights.\n\nChampion by Decree.\n\nIt has been contended that Allen, who learned boxing in England where he fought leading opponents, was not universally recognized as champion. On the other hand, no other man, at that time, had an undisputed claim. Allen seemed to have the best right of all. His claim to be considered champion was quite as good as that of Schmeling, who came to this country after Tunney had retired and fought Jack Sharkey in what the New York Commission declared would be a title fight.\n\nAnd when they fought Schmeling won—on a foul, after his foe had given him a savage beating for four rounds. Not a very sound claim for championship honors. Our own belief is that Allen is."

    text: "At last, a champion. St. Louis may be able to boast about its first world championship fighter tomorrow. That will happen if the homebred Negro, Henry Armstrong, defeats Petey Sarron, a Syrian, of Birmingham, Ala., at Madison Square Garden, New York.\n\nIn all the years since the Allens outgrew the division and lost, and the Daleys first put fighting over big in this city more than 70 years ago, no St. Louis-born boxer, whether of the bare-knuckle or glove variety, has ever risen high enough to establish a valid claim to a world title. In the present century, several capable fighters developed here—men like Harry Trendall, Leo Kelley, Harry Kabakoff, Kid Bandy, Benny McGovern, George Kirkwood, Ollie Kirk, and several others; but although several of these were on occasions matched with titleholders, none ever came through.\n\nThe only St. Louis fighter making his home here to claim the title and gain at least partial recognition as a world champion was not native-born. He was the late Tom Allen, whom many still remember as the proprietor of a saloon on Market Street east of Seventh.\n\nAllen, English-born, settled in St. Louis in the sixties and brought with him a pretty good fighting reputation. He claimed the title before a championship match in 1869 with Mike McCoole, another publican. Although Allen won the fight, the referee, intimidated by McCoole’s backers and a mob of toughs, gave the decision to McCoole, who then claimed the title. They fought four years later on an island in the Mississippi, and this time Allen cut McCoole to ribbons in seven rounds and regained the crown. He held it until beaten by Joe Goss. Afterward, Allen retired and changed the old name of his saloon to the one it carried for many years—“Champion’s Rest.”\n\nAllen's influence had much to do with the development of St. Louis as a boxing center. His place, besides the saloon in front, included a large back room with a ring pitched in one corner. In another corner was a platform for a piano.\n\nTom Allen, head and gavel in hand, sat near the doorway between the two rooms and acted as master of ceremonies or, if need be, bouncer. Tom had icy blue eyes, and with a gavel which he beat on a table to enforce order. If disputants became too noisy and belligerent, they were thrown into the ring, hands gloved, and told to fight it out. On other occasions, regular boxing bouts were arranged, and the spectators tossed coins to the contenders in proportion to the interest their bout excited.\n\nTom died in 1904, and the “Champion's Rest” passed out of existence soon after, to make room for modern buildings. But since Allen's time, this city has not claimed a titleholder, either home-bred or one who established a permanent residence here, with the exception perhaps of Abe Attell and Harry Forbes, who dwelt here for a year or so in the days when Hardluck Charley Haughton operated. It was here that Attell defeated Forbes for the featherweight title, knocking him out in the fifth round. Brooklyn Tommy Sullivan, who still resides here, has been given credit for winning the featherweight crown when he knocked out Attell at a local arena. That fight aroused plenty of grapevine comment, however. A foul was claimed by Attell but not allowed.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the fight was not at the featherweight limit, and no title was involved. Sullivan weighed 124 pounds, whereas in those days the limit for this division was 122 pounds, ringside. A short time afterwards, Attell knocked out Sullivan in San Francisco in six rounds.\n\nThe featherweight division has developed some great fighters, among them such noted battlers as George Dixon, Terrible Terry McGovern, and others.",

And if he is a bit incandescent about matters relating to justice, fairness, and that sort of thing, you can't blame him.\n\nThe party is one Arturo Godoy, and he's from Iqueque, Chile. Very properly, Godoy wants to know how it comes that a venerable third rater named Jack Roper and a beer-guzzling bartender named Tony Galento rate matches with Joe Louis. Roper is to fight the Brown Bomber at Wrigley Field, Los Angeles, April 28, and there will be a lot of money in the park. Galento gets the mid-summer plum, which in advance has been estimated to gross three-fourths of a million dollars. Godoy gets—well, Arturo gets the run-around, notwithstanding he had knocked out Roper in eight rounds and, in the same year, twice defeated Galento. Both of his victims are past the age when improvement is likely to set in. If records mean anything, therefore, Godoy rates a title bout ahead of both the men now awarded championship events. Ignoring him in favor of the other two men really does not make sense.\n\nApparently, all the cum laude graduates from the college of hard knocks, alias the boxing game, wind up in the saloon business first—and later in the bankruptcy court. The white light that beats upon Two-ton Tony's New Jersey wet goods emporium shines also on the thirst palaces of Jack Dempsey in New York and Florida, of Tom Heeney and Mickey Walker in Manhattan, and of Jack Sharkey in Boston. Nearly all of these, if history repeats itself, will wind up in the discard, although Jack Dempsey and Sharkey have hung on for a number of years. Jim Braddock and Mickey Walker already have lost out, although the neon lights bearing Walker's moniker pad that establishment.\n\nIt's an old, old custom among pugilists to get into the saloon business. It originated in England and got a big start in this country here in St. Louis when the British fighter Tom Allen settled here in the sixties. Allen was rated world champion until late in his career Joe Goss defeated him. That was in the early seventies. Allen soon afterward opened a saloon on Market street near Seventh, which, very appropriately, he named “Champion's Rest.” There Tom flourished until his death early this century."

Oxie Lawson and Denny Galehouse didn't have anything that puzzled the Boston Bees this afternoon and Casey Stengel's National Leaguers, gathering 15 hits off the Boston pitching, tied the spring series at five victories each by defeating Fred Haney's ambitious club, 7 to 4.\n\nLawson started for the Browns and was hit safely in each of his innings on the hill. In contrast, the Boston pitching was brilliant. Manuel Salvo, a right-hander obtained from the Giants in the Cuccinello trade, hurled seven innings and was almost unhittable until he tired in his final frame. Harlond Clift opened the game with a home run over the left field fence and a double by Radcliff in the sixth was the only other Brownie safety until the seventh.\n\nAfter the Browns bunched three of their hits with two passes to score three runs in the seventh, Jack Errickson took over the hurling and yielded three hits in two innings, but prevented further scoring.\n\nWhile Lawson was hit freely, he was tight in the pinches until the eighth when Gene Moore, beat out a bunt, took third on Rowell's single to right and scored the tying run while Clift, Heffner and McQuinn were turning a double play on Masi.\n\nHeavyweight Joe Louis and Trainer Jack Blackburn, prepping the fighter in his workout at the Pine street Y.

There were balks, errors, walks, hit batsmen and double plays and when it was all over the Phils were the winners, 15 to 8.\n\nMaybe the same thing would have happened to any pitcher Manager Southworth had chosen but chief responsibility for the rout falls on the little screwball pitcher, Murry Dickson who opened the game but had to be taken out before he had retired a single batter in the first inning.\n\nSeven men faced Dickson, six of them lashed his pitches for base hits including a home run by Livingston, the Phils nifty-looking catcher, poled the ball over the left field fence. The sum of the first inning massacre was eight runs and the ball game and the afternoon and the Cardinals’ trip to beautiful Miami was ruined.\n\nIt mattered little that the Cards battered Si Johnson and his successor, Ray Bruner, for a lead. They were so far behind that it was “no contest,” something Bert at St. Louis. Best of the Cards’ three pitchers was Newt Kimball who held the Phils scoreless in the last three innings."

    text: "It will be 100 years to the day next May 22 that Tom Allen, almost the last of the bare knuckle boxing champions, enjoyed the greatest moment of his life.\n\nHe was no longer the champion, having lost the title to Joe Goss on an island near Covington, Ky., on Sept. 7, 1876. Allen was disqualified for committing a foul in the 21st round and it must have been a flagrant violation because in those days gouging, kneeing, heeling, kicking and tripping were established niceties of the sport.\n\nTwo years later he returned to his native England and on May 22, 1878, appropriate ceremonies to honor him took place.\n\nHe was presented a huge silver cup on which were inscribed the words “Presented To Tom Allen, Champion Boxer of England, by his buddies and admirers as a token of their admiration of his skill and science, May 22, 1878, at the Cambridge Hall, Newman St., and Oxford St., London, England.”\n\nThat cup today holds a place of honor in the home of his great grandson, Thomas Allen Taylor, chairman of the board of Seven Up Bottling Co.\n\n“My father retrieved this cup from a pawn shop on Market Street in 1938,” Tom Taylor said, “but I have no idea where it was from the time Tom Allen died just past the turn of the century until my dad found it.”\n\nThe cup is the sole remaining tangible reward of the career of Tom Allen, St. Louis saloon keeper. If some of the episodes have a ring familiar to what you read about boxing today, it is ample evidence that the game hasn’t changed much except to put gloves on the combatants.\n\nAllen’s saloon was called Sportsmen’s Rest and was located on Market Street, between 6th and 7th, where the old American Theater once stood. The site today is a parking lot just west of Kiener Plaza.\n\nBy Tom Allen’s frank admission, Sportsmen’s Rest was a saloon, nothing more, a rugged drinking place for fur traders, for river men and for anyone else who wandered in.\n\nWhenever an argument broke out up front and could not be settled with words, the principals retired to the back room, accompanied by anybody who happened to be in the place and settled the difference with their bare hands. It was a dangerous procedure because boxing or fighting was strictly against the law. If someone in the place ran out onto Market Street yelling “fight,” the police would move in, arrest the principals and haul them off to the constabulary where heavy fines were assessed.\n\nBecause St. Louis is hard by the Mississippi, the area was the hub of bare knuckle fighting in the ’60s and ’70s. If the fighters really meant business, they and friends would hire a boat and everybody would go out to one of the many islands in the Mississippi.\n\nWhen they arrived, the spectators would form a ring around the fighters (which is why the squared fight area of today is still called a ring), some planks would be laid on the ground. The fighters, their seconds and the spectators would then put up the money for which the combatants would contest on a winner-take-all basis.\n\nThere was one further bit of formal ceremony. Each fighter would stand in the crowd until the challenger took off his cap or hat and tossed it into the ring. That expression “throwing his hat in the ring,” still exists.\n\nMost of the onlookers would crowd around the fighters but a few had a special assignment. They would clamber into trees, not only because they could have a better view of the proceedings but they could also keep a wary eye out for police who might have been alerted and were en route across the water to break up the brawl.\n\nThis particular bare knuckle era started in 1865. John Heenan had been the champion, had been inactive for several years. Assuming that Heenan had retired, Joe Coburn fought Bill McCoole in Cumberland, Md. in 1863 and Coburn won on a knockout in the 63rd round.\n\nTwo years later Coburn announced his retirement and McCoole claimed the title. In 1869, Allen reinforced his claim to No. 1 challenger by finishing off Bill Davis in 43 rounds on Chouteau Island and issued a challenge to McCoole.\n\nMcCoole, a huge Irishman who outweighed Tom by as many as 45 pounds, and Allen did not like each other. It was more than a challenge for boxing supremacy. They had violent arguments whenever they met. On some occasions they came to blows with nothing at stake. Allen accused McCoole of ducking him.\n\nFinally McCoole agreed to put his claim to the title on the line and he and Allen met on Carpenter’s Island on June 15, 1869. News stories said Allen was winning fair and square when the bout was stopped. The next night, on the stage of a theater, the referee announced that McCoole had retained his title, that Allen had been disqualified for a foul.\n\nLater the referee was to amend his story, say that he had been intimidated into declaring McCoole the winner. Apparently more than the normal amount of money was bet on the fight, estimates going as high as $25,000. Professional gamblers were betting on McCoole. When they saw things going badly for their fighter, they swarmed the ring, assaulted the referee and brought the fight to an end in a bloody brawl.\n\nThe whole thing was not a total loss for Allen. He had the liquor concession.\n\n“Whenever we arranged a fight on one of the islands,” he said, “I'd take care of the whiskey. For that first fight with McCoole, we must have had 1,400 or 1,500 men assembled and they all came to drink and watch the fight.”\n\nFour years intervened before Allen got another shot at McCoole.\n\nA year later, the famed Jem Mace came into the picture, took on Allen at Kennersville, La., won on a 10th-round knockout. (Rounds ended in those days when one fighter was knocked down...if he could not continue the bout was over.) Mace claimed the heavyweight title. One of those to contest his claim was an aging Joe Coburn who came out of retirement.\n\nMace and Coburn fought twice in 1871 without conclusive result. The first was stopped by police. On the second occasion, they fought 12 rounds...then suddenly quit and walked out of the ring without explanation. (It was later said that their seconds told them that the gambler holding the side bets had absconded with the money. Since there was no point in continuing, they quit.)\n\nMace and Coburn ceased their ring activities with that unsatisfactory performance and that left the field once more to those old rivals, Allen and McCoole.\n\nAfter many threats and challenges, they agreed on a rematch on Sept. 23, 1871, on Chouteau’s Island. Allen beat McCoole into a bloody pulp in three or four rounds, at the end of which time McCoole’s seconds wanted to call it off. He refused and took a savage pounding from Allen until he collapsed into a heap in the eleventh round and that ended it.\n\nAllen’s claim to the title was without dispute then until he lost on the foul to Joe Goss. After that Allen took leave of his saloon briefly to return to his native England where in 1878 he received the coveted cup.\n\nHe returned to Sportsmen’s Rest which he continued to operate until he died on April 6, 1903.\n\nHe was living evidence of why the rules had to be amended. He had paid a terrible physical price. His face was lined with scars. He had another terrible scar on his right hand. In a fight with one Charley Gallagher, someone fired a shot and the ball struck Allen’s hand. A doctor examined it, pried the bullet loose, swabbed the hand and ordered the fight to go on. “It didn’t hit the muscle,” Allen said, “so I just kept on fighting and won.”\n\nThe most obvious — and gruesome — evidence of the toll the fights took were Allen’s hands. Pictures of him in later years showed his hands to be shapeless hunks, the knuckles gone, eroded by the constant pounding they not only inflicted but absorbed."

    text: "We would like to finish a story which began on the special sports page in the weekend edition of The Globe-Democrat. Because of space problems, the finishing touches to the life of Tom Allen, one of the last of the bare-knuckle heavyweight champions of the world, were left untold.\n\nHe had been a saloon keeper in St. Louis, had operated the Sportsmen’s Rest at Sixth and Market, had defeated Bill McCoole for the championship on Chouteau Island in the Mississippi in September of 1871. He defended against all comers until 1876 when he lost the title on a foul to Joe Goss. Two years later he returned to his native England for a visit, was presented with a huge silver cup by his friends and admirers.\n\nAllen lost interest in boxing when the Marquis of Queensberry, appalled by the bloody carnage he had witnessed in the bare knuckle brawls, refined the rules of the game. Fighters wore skin-tight gloves, gouging and kneeing and tripping were barred — and Allen retired. “They've made it a sissy sport,” he said. “I want no part of it.”\n\nHis daughter Mary, who also was called Polly, returned to the United States with him and she subsequently married Edward Taylor of St. Louis. They are the grandparents of Thomas Allen Taylor, chairman of the Board of the Seven Up Company, who has the famed cup in his possession and who in his spare time has tried to find out more about his great grandfather without too much success.\n\n“All I know is what I've read in old newspaper accounts,” says Tom Taylor, “plus some family memories.” When Allen died in 1903, it was assumed he left some money. After all, his saloon had been prosperous, he had made a fair amount of money selling whiskey to the spectators who gathered for the fights on the islands. In addition, the side bets on several of the fights were substantial, amounting in at least one instance to $25,000.\n\nHis will left everything to his daughter, Polly Allen Taylor, and to a friend. When the will was submitted to probate, however, it was discovered that the will amounted to $278.35. “I have learned,” said Tom Taylor, “that the silver cup went to Miss Hargrove — but where it was from 1903 when Tom Allen died until my father retrieved it from a Market Street pawn shop in 1938, I have no idea.”\n\nThere has been a story in the family, too, that Tom Allen came into possession of a diamond belt, emblematic of the World championship. “Various of my relatives have talked about it,” Taylor said, “but no one can verify that it ever existed or where it is today.” He plans to offer the silver cup, the lone remaining memento of his great grandfather's reign as champion, to the Missouri Historical Society.\n\nAs the foregoing suggests and as the following substantiates, boxing always has lived in a world all its own. There is nothing like it really. To those on the outside, it is inexplicable and perhaps repugnant. To those who have been a part of it, the sport borders on a religion."

Mr. Richard K. Fox, who recently proposed to wager $5,000 that Mr. Allen could defeat Mr. John L. Sullivan of Boston in the prize ring, was overwhelmed with letters from friends and admirers urging him to turn Mr. Allen adrift or to take him “out of the race.” Mr. Fox had posted $1,000 with Mr. Harry Hill and had defied Mr. Sullivan to cover that amount and thus make known his desire to fight Mr. Allen. It was suggested to Mr. Fox by numerous correspondents that he could win money by withdrawing the $1,000 posted with Mr. Hill before Mr. Sullivan had an opportunity to cover it.\n\nNo sign was made at the office of the Police Gazette, and it was intimated that he had gone to Coney Island or elsewhere. Mr. Fox instructed Mr. Harding, his representative, to visit Mr. Hill's theatre that evening and secure the $1,000 which had been posted for Mr. Allen, but for some unexplained reason Mr. Harding failed to do so. \n\nA prominent sporting gentleman visited the establishment and waited for Mr. Harding's arrival. It was known that Mr. Sullivan had returned to Boston, but Mr. Robert Farrell, one of that gentleman's most confidential friends, was in town. He said to Mr. Fox,\n\nthat if Mr. Harding could not withdraw the money, he was anxious that Sullivan should fight Mr. Allen. Mr. Hill said that articles of agreement could not be signed without the parties consenting to the match.\n\nA group of sporting gentlemen waited until a late hour. Mr. Farrell claimed for Mr. Sullivan the $1,000 posted by Mr. Fox. Mr. Hill objected to giving up the money, saying that Mr. Harding must be present and declare that Mr. Allen will not fight. Mr. Farrell departed, saying he would return today for the money. The sporting gentlemen left querying among themselves. Mr. Sullivan's match to fight Mr. Allen with hard gloves in Chicago has been postponed.",

He pushed his \"bunch of fives\" forward with such force that he lost his equilibrium, and, before he could recall the blow, his opponent received the blow below the belt and was declared the winner.

Heenan was foully robbed of a well-earned and clean-cut victory off England's stocky champion, Tom Sayers.\n\nThere wasn't a moment during that memorable encounter when Sayers showed the least glimmer of superiority over the handsome, stalwart gladiator from over the briny. Before entering the ring, Heenan was supplied with valuable information as to Sayers' tactics. Sayers, deep-chested, chunky, round, muscular, wielded a right hand that had felled many a foeman, a right that was dubbed \"the auctioneer,\" because it had \"knocked down\" so many, an expression that was voted as being quite facetious in the phlegmatic English idea of humor.\n\nSayers’ terrific rushes and dangerous right swings were met by Heenan's left arm, which, as a human shield, brushed off Sayers’ right repeatedly. Early in the battle Sayers' flail-like arm was broken over the elbow of the American. He was slow in swinging, and Heenan flung out his elbow, meeting “the auctioneer right” at the joint of the fore and upper arm. The break was a painful one, and blasted Sayers’ hopes of winning, but he stuck manfully to his task until reinforcements appeared on the scene in the shape of a posse of friends, who swarmed around the ring and cut the ropes when Sayers was sent to grass with a hard right, completely knocked out.\n\nThe affair ended in a free-for-all fight, and Heenan was robbed of the stake he had justly earned.\n\nHeenan “Doped” This Time.\n\nThis memorable battle, which involved the world’s championship, was fought at Farnborough, England, in April, 1860, and aroused more sensational ado in America than a Presidential election. Heenan was the idol of the American lovers of the sport, and even more popular in his day than his successor of a later generation, the magnetic Sullivan. That Heenan was outrageously dealt with was admitted by the elder Marquis of Queensberry, for whom the boxing rules were named. He witnessed the battle, along with other sprigs of English nobility who \"fancied a mill.\"\n\nThe American press ridiculed in editorial and cartoon the much-boasted fair-play of the English.\n\nHeenan was the victim of another job in England, when early in the sixties he fought Tom King, rather an overrated boxer, so the chronicles of the time agreed. The American forced the issue, and had the battle well in hand until he suddenly and mysteriously collapsed, as if some unseen hand had paralyzed his brain. Ugly rumors spread about London to the effect that the American was beaten by his own second. It was charged that Heenan was drugged by George McDonald, an English boxer who administered to the American's wants between the rounds.\n\nOn his deathbed, McDonald is said to have confessed that he stole away Heenan's brain by \"doping\" the water and sponge.\n\nBritish Boxer Twice Robbed.\n\nBut the English sports evened themselves with the American by ridiculing Yankee fair play ten years later, when Tom Allen, an English boxer of science and renown, was robbed of two hard-earned battles, one with Joe Goss and the other with Mike McCool. Allen met Goss in a ring pitched on the blue sward of Kentucky. During the battle, a sheriff and his squad of deputies swooped down on the warriors, who, with their seconds, the referee, and a mob of as mildly-mannered men as ever discovered watches and jewelry in a crowd, fled to an adjoining county.\n\nThe referee, one Eph Holland, from Boston, was fixed to give Goss the decision, and he declared Goss the winner on a foul after the Englishman had beaten his adversary almost blind and insensible.\n\nAllen's plight was similar to Fitzsimmons, in that there was no apparent object in the Englishman's committing a foul after he had clearly bested his man. Allen's backer, Fred Watkins, was victimized to the tune of $1,000 by Holland.\n\nA few minutes before the call of time Watkins flourished $1,000. Holland produced a wad of green, claiming his roll contained $1,000, and that it was given to bet on Goss. Watkins foolishly handed his money to Holland, who escaped with the money, beside robbing Allen of a victory.\n\nAllen also met big Mike McCool, a burly Irishman, whose muscle was developed on the levee of the Mound City as a roustabout. McCool had trimmed all the roustabouts on the banks of the Mississippi from Alton to New Orleans, and his backers proclaimed him a world-beater. Allen revolved around McCool like a cooper circumnavigating a barrel, and beat him, but the referee cried foul. McCool afterward protested that he had not beaten Allen.\n\nJohn C. Morrissey’s heelers made a boss from an awful hiding Sullivan's hands. This memorable battle occurred almost forty years ago. Sullivan was Morrissey’s master as a scientist, and would have won but for the threats and interference of the Morrissey mob. Sullivan went around the horn to Frisco and was lynched by a party of California \"avengers,\" who claimed that the luckless Sullivan was an outlaw and guilty of any number of black-hearted deeds.\n\nAbingdon Baird Accused.\n\nIn recent years, the robbers in the ring have not been as numerous. The organization of clubs and \"pulling off\" of fights by reputable exploiters of the sport has lessened the chances of crookedness.\n\nThe McAuliffe-Carney encounter at Revere Beach, Mass., nine years ago, for the championship of America and England, leaves a blot on McAuliffe's career. Carney clearly outfought McAuliffe, and had Jack tired, groggy, and whipped, when the referee, an American, saved Jack's reputation by making a draw. Frank Slavin, the Sydney Cornstalk, was denied a victory over Jem Smith in 1889. Smith was overpowered quickly in the fray, but his gang assaulted the Australians with sticks and knuckle-dusters. Abingdon Baird was somehow implicated with the Bladestreet by the National Club, yet maintained his innocence and was afterward acquitted by sporting friends in London.",

    text: "NEWS OF THE PUGILISTS.  \nJOHN HEENAN WAS TWICE CHEATED IN ENGLAND—OTHER FRAUDS.  \nThe Fitzsimmons-Sharkey conflict is still shrouded in mystery and will doubtless pass into the history of the ring among the category of remarkable events. Through the pages of Fistiana are interspersed many odd and curious happenings and diabolical plots, still green in the memory of a generation of sports, many of whom are gathered away under the daisies, while the survivors, frosty of temple and wide of girth—recall their June days when Heenan and Morrissey, Sayers and Yankee Sullivan, were in their affluence.\n\nThe sporting world was shocked to its depths by the startling report from England that John C. Heenan was foully robbed of a well-earned and clean-cut victory over England's stocky champion, Tom Sayers. A writer in the Washington paper stated:\n\"There wasn't a moment during that memorable encounter when Sayers showed the least glimmer of superiority over the handsome, stalwart gladiator from across the briny. Before entering the ring, Heenan was supplied with valuable information as to Sayers's tactics. Sayers, deep-chested, chunky, round, muscular, wielded a right that was dubbed ‘the auctioneer,’ because it had ‘knocked down’ so many, an expression that was quite facetious in the phlegmatic English idea of humor.\n\n\"Sayers's terrific rushes and dangerous right swings were met by Heenan's left arm, which, as a human shield, brushed off Sayers's right repeatedly.

Heenan was the idol of the American lovers of the sport, and even more popular in his day than his successor of a later generation, the magnetic Sullivan.\n\n“That Heenan was outrageously dealt with was admitted by the elder Marquis of Queensberry, for whom the boxing rules were named. He witnessed the battle along with other sprigs of English nobility who ‘tawicid a mill.’\n\nThe American press ridiculed in editorial and cartoon the much-boasted fair play of the English.\n\n“Again, when early in the sixties he fought Tom King, rather an overrated pugilist, Heenan was again cheated. English sporting chronicles of the time agreed. The American forced the issue and had the battle well in hand till he suddenly and mysteriously collapsed, as if some unseen hand had paralyzed his brain. Ugly rumors spread about London to the effect that the American was beaten by his own second. It was charged that Heenan was doped by McDonald, an Englishman, who administered to the American’s wants between the rounds.\n\nOn his deathbed, McDonald is said to have confessed that he stole away Heenan's brain by doping the water and sponge. English sports evened themselves with the American by ridiculing Yankee fair play 10 years later, when Tom Allen, an English boxer of science and renown, was robbed of two hard-earned battles, one with Joe Goss and the other with Mike McCool.\n\nAllen met Goss in a ring pitched on the blue sward of Kentucky. During the battle, a sheriff and his squad of deputies swooped down on the warriors, who, with their seconds, the referee, and still others, fled to a remote corner of the county.\n\nThe referee, one Eph Holland from Boston, fixed to give Goss a victory, disregarded the decision. Allen's plight was similar to Fitzsimmons', only that Goss succeeded in committing a foul after he had clearly bested his man. Allen's backer, Fred Watkins, was victimized by the wandering Eph from Boston, who took Watkins to one side and handed him a $1,000 roll, which the said Eph declared to be the holder of the bets.\n\nAllen also met big Mike McCool, a burly Irishman, whose muscle developed on the river, where he trimmed all the roustabouts on the banks of the Mississippi, from Alton to New Orleans. His backer was swindled by a similar scheme. Allen succeeded in cutting his man up like the cooper circumventing a barrel, but the referee pronounced the foul gag. McCool afterwards acknowledged that he was fairly beaten by Allen.\n\nJohn C. Heenan's plucky gameness and exceptional bravery won the hearts of his comrades, for Morrissey's long reach and superior skill in the bout hollowed the opponent's flanks.\n\nCorrupt practices and pulling off of fights by exploiters of the sport lessened the chances for honest pugilists. The battle at Revere Beach, Mass., nine years ago, one of which was entitled the championship of America and England, remains a blot on McAuliffe's career. Carroll clearly outfought McAuliffe and had Jack tired, groggy, and whipped, when the referee, an American, saved Jack's reputation by declaring a draw.\n\nPeter Jackson, the Sydney Cornstalk, was deprived of a victory over Jem Smith in 1889. Smith was overpowered early in the fray, but the crowd croaked against the darkey with hoots and jeers for his skin, and finally took the field himself to earn their spite and obloquy.\n\nAllen's testimony stands as a memento of the bravery of a bygone day. He swears: \"There was no mark on Sharkey's groin when he was carried to his dressing-room after the fight.\"\n\nSan Francisco, Cal., Dec. 10.—In the Fitzsimmons trial today, Dow Allen, assistant trainer for Sharkey, testified that in the eighth round Fitzsimmons knocked Sharkey out completely. Fitzsimmons made no foul, and as one of Sharkey's seconds he claimed none, but after Sharkey was knocked out, witness jumped into the ring and waved a towel as a token of surrender.\n\nThe witness said he and Billy Smith carried Sharkey into the dressing-room. Sharkey was limp and groaning, but the only marks of the fight were on his face. He made nothing of a foul blow, and when examined there was no mark on his groin. Sharkey was then dressed by the witness and Billy Smith and taken to his hotel. Witness said that no marks were visible until after the doctor was closeted with Sharkey. After the doctor left, the witness again saw Sharkey, whose groin was covered with blood-stained cloth.\n\nCORBETT ON A NEW TACK.  \nSan Francisco, Cal., Dec. 10.—Harry Corbett is in receipt of a long telegram from Jim Corbett authorizing him to make every effort to get on a match with Fitzsimmons, and as a result, he is out with the following:\n\n“Corbett will meet Fitzsimmons before the Olympic Club for from five to 30 rounds and for a side bet of from $1,000 to $10,000 and for any purse offered. The size of the purse can be $10,000 or $15,000. In order to show his readiness to fight, Corbett will not insist on a side bet. In regard to the selection of a referee, Corbett is willing to leave the appointment to Col. Greer Harrison and Maj. McLaughlin.”\n\nRUNNING RACES.\n\nPATSY MCDERMOTT WILL SHIP HORSES TO VENEZUELA—RESULTS AND ENTRIES.\n\nIron Hill, Md., Dec. 10.—Patsy McDermott, the jockey and horse-owner, has shipped three of his horses to Venezuela, and he intends going there to ride them.

    text: "MR. HARDING NOT THERE.  \nMR. FARRELL CLAIMS THE $1,000 POSTED BY MR. FOX FOR MR. ALLEN.\n\nThe unsatisfactory appearance of the distinguished Mr. Tom Allen as a boxer in the art gallery of the Madison Square Garden on Monday evening was yesterday the chief topic in sporting society. Mr. Richard K. Fox, who recently proposed to wager $5,000 that Mr. Allen could defeat Mr. John L. Sullivan, of Boston, in the prize ring, was overwhelmed with letters from friends and admirers urging him to turn Mr. Allen adrift or to take him \"out of the race.\" Mr. Fox had posted $1,000 with Mr. Harry Hill and had defied Mr. Sullivan to cover that amount and thus make known his desire to fight Mr. Allen. It was suggested to Mr. Fox by numerous correspondents that he could win money by withdrawing the $1,000 posted with Mr. Hill before Mr. Sullivan had an opportunity to cover it. \n\nMr. Allen did not appear at the office of the garden, and it was intimated that he had gone to Long Island for a rest. His representative, Mr. Harding, was to visit Mr. Hill at the theatre last evening and secure the $1,000 which had been posted for Mr. Allen, but for some unexplained reason, Mr. Harding did not go to the theatre. A number of sporting gentlemen gathered in Mr. Hill's establishment and awaited his arrival. \n\nIt was said, however, that Mr. Farrell, one of the gentlemen present, declared that he was there to cover the $1,000 posted by Mr. Fox so that Mr. Harding could not withdraw the sum. He was anxious that Mr. Sullivan should meet Mr. Allen. Mr. Hill said that articles of agreement could not be signed in his house, as he was not willing to go to jail for permitting the composition of a prize fight contract. The sporting gentlemen waited for a long time.\n\nThere was no word from Mr. Harding, and as he did not appear, Mr. Farrell claimed for himself the $1,000 posted by Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox opposed giving up the money, saying that Mr. Harding had not declared that Mr. Allen was out of the race. Mr. Farrell departed, saying he would return to-day for the money. The sporting society awaits the outcome.",

    text: "THE BULLY BOXER.\n\nTom Allen in Town—With His Friends.\n\nWhat He Has to Say About Current Events—Hogan Won't Come Up to the Scratch—Omaha the Place of Meeting—Allen in Fine Trim and Prepared for Fun.\n\nTom Allen and Arthur Chambers, the lightweight champion, arrived in the city yesterday and were joined last night by Jack Madden, Allen's trainer, and others of the same party. Tom paid his respects to the Times last evening, when our reporter had a quiet, little social chat upon the events of the past few weeks and exchanged a few hints as to the whereabouts and the time of the coming fight between Allen and Hogan.\n\nThe celebrated young champion appears in first-class condition. He says he never was better prepared for business than at present. He will strip to about 180 pounds now and expresses himself as eager for the test of muscle and skill within the ring. He wears none of the scars and marks of his many hard-fought battles upon his person but appears as trim and neat as though dropped from a bandbox. He appears not more than 28 or 30 years old, weighs about 190 pounds when dressed; his muscle is as hard as wood, so hard that a pair of pincers would hardly take hold of his legs or arms. His hands are black and bronzed by hard training, and to judge from present appearances, Hogan (if he ever meets him in the ring) will stand a chance of getting one of the best thumpings ever given above the turf.\n\nHIS OPINION OF HOGAN.\n\nTom seems to estimate Hogan's chances of winning the coming fight as rather slim. “Hogan,” he says, “never intended to fight me. He has never been in the ring to my knowledge, and when he challenged me to this fight, he knew just what he had to expect.”\n\n“What do you think he challenged you for?”\n\n“Oh! for a little cheap notoriety. He is now playing his cards for a draw.”\n\n“Did he make any propositions to back out?”\n\n“Well, only yesterday he made propositions to Jack Looney to forfeit his share of the money, which is $1,000, if we would draw off and make it a draw.”\n\n“What does he mean by that?”\n\n“Oh! just this. He don't want to meet me. He never intended to meet me. Why, he refused to fight Jack Madden, my trainer, and then had the impudence to challenge me. Any d—d fool can challenge me, but coming into the ring is another thing.”\n\n“What does Hogan gain by this backdown?\"\n\n“It is as I told you before. He wants notoriety. He thought it would be a big thing for him to get up all this noise, and then after getting Jack Looney to declare it a draw fight, he can show himself as the man who had made a draw fight with Tom Allen.”\n\n“Do you think Hogan will not fight you?\"\n\n“I did not say that. But I do think he never intended to put up his fists before me, and I now am sure he wants to back down from the fight.”\n\n“If this fight comes off, where will it be?”\n\n“At or near Omaha. Excursion tickets are being sold from St. Louis and return for $20, and we expect to see a pretty large mob there.”\n\n“Will Hogan come to Kansas City?”\n\n“I think he will. The whole mob of St. Louis sports will be here on Wednesday night.”\n\n“And will the fight take place, if at all?”\n\n“On the 18th of this month, or two weeks from tomorrow.”\n\n“Is it your opinion that there was a ‘put-up job’ about that capture of the steamer Continental last week?”\n\n“I do. I don’t think Hogan or his friends had anything to do with it, but I think the officers of the boat put up the entire plan.”\n\n“Will you and Looney take Hogan's $1,000 and consent to call it a draw?”\n\n“No; I will not, nor will Jack Looney. You will see by the St. Louis papers of today just what Looney has to say about it. He explains the whole business. As to Hogan’s money, he has no money put up; it is the people’s money by right and justice. They paid to see the fight and are entitled to the worth of their money, and if Hogan had met me and put up his 'fins' to me, they would have seen what they paid to see. The truth of the whole matter, Mr. Editor, is just this: Hogan doesn’t want to meet me. But if I can get him before me once, we will decide just what is in him.”\n\n“Why don’t you fight at Kansas City?”\n\n(Laughing) “Oh, you see we are bound so by bonds that Missouri soil ain’t good to dance on for now. Besides, they say they are after me with a requisition from Illinois for my fight with Mike McCoole. But I don’t think they want me very bad.”\n\nThe gay and festive young boxer continued the conversation at some length, relating some of his former experiences in the ring and assured the Times that while he did not particularly hanker after the business, he was always open to proposals and would be happy to amuse any ambitious young gentleman in Kansas City for a few rounds at any time. He will give an exhibition here this week with Arthur Chambers, Jack Madden, and others, when we shall see and know more about him.",

    text: "The Proposed Match Between McCoole and Allen a Fizzle.\n\nFrom the St. Louis Times.\n\nThe friends of the American champion, Mike McCoole, and the English boxer, Tom Allen, assembled in large force at Alex. Mefgeo's Broad Gauge Saloon, on Chestnut Street, last night, to arrange the preliminaries for a match between the two; $2,500 a side. The burly, good-natured Mike was there in propria persona with his \"sponsor,\" while Allen, who was busy superintending the opening of his new saloon on Fifth Street, was represented by Billy Carroll and Sherman Rinor. Carroll opened the meeting by proposing to make the match for $2,500 a side, the fight to be governed by the rules of the London Prize Ring, providing the excursion tickets sold for $10 each, and the proceeds of the excursion be equally divided between the principals.\n\nTo this McCoole readily acceded and was ready to \"put up.\" According to the twenty-second article of the new rules of the ring, each should appear in the ring at the time specified in the articles of agreement, forfeiting the battle money; or he would make a match for $2,500 and not bar the article alluded to, provided the excursion money went with the stakes to the winner of the gate. He was also willing to make the match and bar nothing, each man conducting his own part of the excursion. This was objected to by Allen's backers, and Carroll proposed to make the match for $1,000 a side, and let each man pick six of his friends, who would be the only witnesses of the event, also for $1,000, and the winner take the excursion money.\n\nHalf a dozen other propositions were made by both parties, which resulted in nothing definitive. It appears that neither side was willing to settle on a plan. In our opinion, it would have been very easy to make the match for any amount and not guard themselves with all these technicalities, a very proper action to put up a large sum on their man, while by the chance of not bringing on the fight. \n\nAs things now appear, there will be no match. McCoole is disgusted, he says, with the matter and wants to hear no more from it. \n\nThat is, in the event of magisterial or other interference, or the approach of darkness coming on, the referee shall have the power to name the time and place for the next meeting, if possible, on the same day; or as soon after as may be.",

    text: "40M SHARKEY PREPARING AN  \nELEGANT HOME FOR HIS AGED  \nFATHER AND MOTHER  \nPUGILIST WORTH A FORTUNE  \nTom Allen's Patient, Faithful and  \nDevoted Daughter—Prof. Clark’s  \nVenerable Mother—Demp-  \nsey's Loyal Wife,\n\nThe public sees only the fierce side of  \nthe nature of the boxer or pugilist, but  \nthere is another side that is human, and  \nit is pleasing to be able to say that it ap-  \nplies to many of the famous ring glad-  \niators who have been noted for their fe-  \nrocity. Tom Hyer was ashamed to go  \nhome after a battle in which he received  \na black eye, for the reason that it might  \ndistress his relatives. Nat Langham lov-  \ned a lass who was opposed to his call-  \ning, and after his successful fight with  \nTom Sayer he agreed to never again en-  \nter a ring. Had Andy Bowen followed  \nthe impulse once expressed to the writer,  \nin his New Orleans home, he might not  \nhave lost his life at the hands of George  \nLavigne. Mrs. Bowen was a sweet-faced  \nlittle woman, who dreaded the hours dur-  \ning which her husband was engaged in  \nbattle. She had a foreboding that he  \nwould be killed, as he finally was. Bowen  \nworshiped her, and his home was bright,  \ncosy and happy. He had promised his  \nwife and himself that so soon as he had  \ngained sufficient worldly goods to embark  \nin some other business he would fight no  \nmore. But that day never came. Death  \nin the ring intervened.\n\nSHARKEY'S FILIAL AFFECTION.\n\nTom Sharkey, the sturdy man-of-war’s-  \nman, who has fought many a desperate  \nbattle in the ring, has amassed a fortune,  \nand is today said to be worth near $100,-  \n000. He has just purchased a big estate  \nat Sheepshead Bay, N. Y., and has per-  \nmanently located there. Of his inten-  \ntions Sharkey says:\n\n“My motive in buying this property was  \nto provide my dear parents a home of the  \nfirst order. I mean to stop at nothing in  \nthe way of expense, but will go right  \nahead and furnish every room with the  \nbest of everything required, regardless of  \ncost. I am determined to fulfill my in-  \ntention of showing gratitude and love for  \nmy dear father and mother.\"\n\nSharkey is a money-saver as well as  \nmaker. His habits are of the best. He  \nis not what the boxing world would des-  \nignate a ‘good fellow.’ That was the  \ntitle worn by John L. Sullivan, and it  \nmeant to him the expenditure of more  \nmoney than any other man in the ring  \nhas been able to earn. And yet Sharkey  \nis really a good fellow, as is shown in his  \nsolicitude for the happiness and com-  \nfort of his aged parents.\n\nTHAT GIRL OF ALLEN'S.\n\nIn the tumble-down, ramshackle build-  \ning in the “Tenderloin” of St. Louis, on  \nMarket street, in which Tom Allen, “re-  \ntired champion,” nightly directs a con-  \ncert for the entertainment of his patrons,  \nresides a woman who is known to but  \nfew of the people of that city. She is the  \ndaughter of the once probably best  \nknown heavyweight prizefighter in the  \nworld. She is the jewel of the home of  \nthe retired warrior of the ring, and she  \nhas devoted her life to her father. There is  \nan unwritten romance which coupled her  \nname with that of the late Col. Fred  \nWatkins, the lifelong friend and backer  \nof the ring gladiator, in which it is re-  \nlated that for her father's sake she de-  \ncided to remain in charge of her home.  \nIt is also said that in all the years that  \nTom Allen has conducted a concert hall  \nin St. Louis Miss Allen has never crossed  \nits threshold. She shines above, in the  \nportion of the building in which the  \nAllens reside, but knows no more than  \ndoes one who has never been in the  \nplace of what the concert hall looks like.  \nAllen is rough and surly, as a rule, with  \nall he meets, but is as kind and gentle  \nwith the daughter as though she were  \nyet a winsome maid in short skirts.\n\nPROF. CLARK'S OLD MOTHER.\n\nThree years since, Mrs. Clark, mother  \nof the veteran boxer now conducting the  \nNatatorium, in St. Louis, died of old age.  \nThe professor is now approaching the  \neighty-year mark, so it will be seen that  \nMrs. Clark lived to quite an old age.  \n“Willie” had been her support from his  \nboyhood. After the father died, “Willie,”  \nnow ‘professor,’ entered the boxing  \nbooths at English fairs, and met all com-  \ners for a mere pittance, which went to  \nsustain mother and the eight little  \nbrothers and sisters at home. Many a  \nhard knock “Willie” has received at the  \nhands of the horny-fisted miners and  \nother ambitious athletes of all weights,  \nin order that the weekly stipend might  \nbe turned over to mother for the rent of  \nthe humble cottage and the grocer and  \nbutcher. When Prof. Clark came to  \nAmerica the mother came with him, and  \nhis tender solicitude for her comfort  \ncompensated for all the reputation he  \nhad earned in the ring as a stern  \nfighter. Even to this day “Willie” pays  \nregular visits to the green spot in the  \ncemetery where his mother rests, and  \nspeaks of her as reverently as son ever  \nspoke of the woman who gave him life.\n\nDEMPSEY'S LOYAL WIFE.\n\nWhen Jack Dempsey wedded, it was  \nwith a promise to his sweetheart that he  \nwould fight no more. Had he kept that  \npromise he might have been alive today.  \nBut the temptation was too great. In  \nthe day when the gallant “Nonpareil”  \nearned his title of middleweight cham-  \npion of the world, fortunes were not com-  \ning to prizefighters in a night. Twelve  \nthousand dollars was the bait that caused  \nDempsey to do what he had promised  \nto not do, and the match with Bob Fitz-  \nsimmons, which resulted so disastrously  \nfor Dempsey, was made. It was prac-  \ntically his last fight. He never recov-  \nered from the humiliation of the affair,  \nand took to that which wrecks while it  \ncheers. Womanlike, the patient and de-  \nvoted wife was loyal to her husband in  \ndefeat. That fateful night, after Demp-  \nsey had been sorely beaten by the  \nCornishman, without a chance for him to  \nwin, she sat at his bedside and com­ \nforted him in his sorrow. She told him  \nthat defeat must come to all at some  \ntime, and reminded him that his fame  \nwould not die because he had been once  \nvanquished. She did not taunt him with  \nreminders of his broken promise, but  \npainted word pictures of all that was in  \nstore for them now that he was done  \nwith fighting.\n\nCHARLEY MITCHELL'S HOME.\n\nCharley Mitchell, the English boxer,  \nwho has the glory of a draw with the  \nonly John L. Sullivan on his ring record,  \nwedded the pretty daughter of “Pony”  \nMoore, England's famous minstrel. Be­  \ncause of her influence Mitchell is today  \na wealthy man, and has a most interest­  \ning family of which he is proud. Mrs.  \nMitchell is pictured as a rarely beautiful  \nwoman, refined and domestic. Charley  \nMitchell is far from the rough that his  \ncalling would indicate. In his home life  \nhe is more than many a man whose sur­  \nroundings should better him. No word of  \ncensure has ever been heard against  \nMitchell in his treatment of his family.  \nOn the contrary, it is a matter often com­  \nmented upon among those who know him  \nbest that he is a model husband and  \nfather. Not one of his boys will follow  \nthe profession of the father. They have  \nreceived the benefits of an education that  \nwill fit them for the battle of life out­  \nside of the squared circle. His daughters  \nare lovely girls, and the Mitchell family  \nis highly respected in its home circle.\n\nFITZ'S BRAW BABES\n\nBob Fitzsimmons is at the mercy of his  \neldest when at home. Bob would rather  \nface Sharkey than that boy of his, when  \nthe youngster is in a playful mood, for, in  \nthe case of Sharkey, Fitz could repay  \nblow for blow, while young Fitzsimmons  \nis lord of the Fitzsimmons manor, aided  \nand abetted by his good mother, whom Bob  \nworships as the heathen does his god.  \nRose Julian was well known in the the­  \natrical profession when she wedded the  \npugilist whose name is known through­  \nout the world. No word has ever been  \nuttered against her. In referring to the  \nmarriage, Col. John Hopkins, the well­  \nknown veteran theatrical manager, said:\n\n“I cannot understand how a sweet girl  \n—a womanly woman, with all the refine­  \nment and gentleness possessed by Rose  \nJulian, could fall in love with that bear  \nFitzsimmons. She is as lovely a girl as  \never faced the footlights, and I am afraid  \na prizefighter will not make for her a  \nsuitable husband.”\n\nBut Col. Hopkins was in error. Rose  \nJulian made of Fitzsimmons a better man  \nthan he otherwise would have been. She  \nhas yet to find cause to regret the day  \nthat she became his wife. Fitzsimmons  \nlavishes affection and comforts, as well as  \nluxuries, upon his family. A day in his  \nhome would be a revelation to those who  \nnaturally regard the prizefighter as a  \nfierce, uncontrollable animal. Mrs. Fitz­  \nsimmons is queen, and the young Fitzsim­  \nmons are lords of the manor in that  \nhome. Fitz is as meek as the proverbial  \nlamb.\n\nMANY SIMILAR INCIDENTS.\n\nJohn L. Sullivan did much for his pa­  \nrents during his phenomenal career in the  \nring. His father was small of stature,  \nbut it is related that John obeyed orders  \ndelivered by Sullivan père as meekly as  \nthough he were a pygmy ruled by a giant.  \nOut of his earnings he lavishly provided  \nfor his parents. That and the charitable  \ncontributions made by Sullivan were the  \nredeeming features of his career. Jack  \nWilkes, of St. Louis, provided for his wid­ \nowed mother and sisters, with her two  \nboys, and appeared in the ring as ‘Jack  \nWilkes’ in order that their friends might  \nnot know that it was Robert Walker who  \nwas a pugilist. Dick Moore, of St. Paul,  \nhas a soft place in his heart for his home  \npeople. Terry McGovern's wife and boy  \nare his first thought after a battle. They  \nare ever near, and Terry enjoys nothing  \nbetter than a romp with that young glad­  \niator. Joe Choynski married a gentle girl,  \nunused to anything connected with such  \nrough doings as her husband is familiar  \nwith in his ring encounters, and she finds  \nno room for complaint of treatment by  \nher prizefighter husband. A man is what  \nhe is, despite his calling.  \n—Willie Green.",

    text: "GOSSIP OF THE BOXERS.\n\n“When I hear the up-to-date school of boxers throw flowers at each other over their originality, I am reminded of the wise saw of a wise guy about there being nothing new under Old Sol,” mused Billy Madden, the raconteur and Queensberry exploiter. “I am told, for instance, that the left hook punch which Kid McCoy lodged on the mobile visage of Dan Creedon is of latter-day invention, and was never used till Dempsey made his appearance in Queensberry society. Corbett, I am informed, tacked this hook punch to his repertoire of biffs, taking it second-hand from Dempsey. McCoy's edition of the hook, I am further advised, is an elaborated version as it was used by Dempsey. The Kid's hook is applied to the enemy in a lead, and followed by another punch of the same brand as he is in the act of breaking ground.\n\n“I do not wish to steal any luster from the reputation of Dempsey, who, in many respects, was the most original fighter the ring has ever seen. But to credit Jack with being the inventor of the hook blow is thrusting on his reputation honors that do not belong to him. Dempsey was one of the most modest and unassuming boxers I ever met, and the last man on earth to steal the thunder of anyone else. Charley Mitchell was one of the first of the boxers of the Queensberry school to introduce the left hook blow to America.\n\n“In the fall of '82 I resigned from the management of J. L. Sullivan, went to England and organized a boxing tournament, offering prizes for the various classes, cash prizes to the professionals and trophies to the amateurs. A round-faced, hazel-eyed chap from Birmingham, built something after the fashion of Jem Mace, though perhaps a few pounds lighter, was entered in the professional middle-weight class, and was freely touted as the best man in England of his pounds. He was the son of a pharmacist at Birmingham and entered the professional arena in '78. His best achievement was a draw with Jack Bourke, the Irish lad, at Ascot. This Birmingham middleweight was Charley Mitchell, and he monopolized all the honors of both the middle and heavy-weight class in my tournament. He had one of the cleverest and most deceptive left hands that ever assisted in spoiling a face with left jabs.\n\n“I brought him to America, and his career, after his debut in the Madison Square Garden with John L. Sullivan, is well known.\n\n“One of Mitchell's best friends in this country was old Tom Allen, of St. Louis, who knew Charley as a kid around Birmingham. Mitchell and Allen often fell to discussing the tactics of various fighters who had met Allen, and in the course of these chats Charley was given many valuable hints that resulted in the improvement of his science. Perhaps the most valuable pointer he received from Allen was the deceptive left hook. Mitchell rehearsed the hook blow, and used it with good results on Reddy Gallagher, Jack Burke, Dominick McCaffrey, Sherif, the Prussian, and other boxers he met in this country. Mitchell's cunning left was praised by the sporting writers all over the country, and other boxers took it up, Dempsey being among the number. Dempsey had perhaps the most artistic left of any of the boxers of his generation, excepting, of course, Mitchell.\n\n“Jack, a student in his profession, copied Mitchell's hook, and it proved one of his pet punches. Along came Jim Corbett after Dempsey with the hook, which was suggested to him by Dempsey. Tom Ryan, Bob Fitzsimmons, Kid McCoy, Jim Hall, and, in fact, all of the tip-toppers, have cultivated this effective blow. Though Mitchell was the first of the prominent Queensberry boxers to use the hook, and he thanks Tom Allen to this day for this, the cleverest of all his left punches, still Allen is not to be given credit for being the inventor of the blow. In Fitzsimmons’ first battle in America—with Billy McCarthy at San Francisco in '90—the Kangaroo helped McCarthy on the dopy road to Queer street with the hook, and many of the boxers who sat around the ring wondered how Fitz cultivated the blow. I asked Fitz where he stole the hook punch, and he told me that the blow was one of the first he picked up in his instructions received from Mace, who was in Australia early in the eighties giving boxing tournaments and teaching aspirants, Fitz being among the number. The inventor of the hook blow will never be known. I have seen the hook used by Mace, Coburn, Ned O'Baldwin, Goss, and the old London ring-rule fighters of the late sixties and early seventies.”\n\n“One of the gamest little men I ever met was Tommy Hughes, the manager of a vaudeville and athletic show in the eighties,” remarked Jake Kilrain. “Tom wasn't a boxer. He couldn't tell a left jab from a breech clout, but he had enough sand to supply half a dozen pugs. Among Tom's charges, besides Charley Mitchell, were Jack Fogarty, Smiling Billy Clark, Reddy Gallagher, and a couple of wrestlers. On salary days, the ghost did his weekly constitutional for about two months, or until we struck Wheeling, W. Va. Here the spook was afflicted with rheumatism, locomotor ataxia, or some other ailment of the ghostly tribe. We were given our pay in promises. The boxers were lined up on the practice runway waiting to be introduced to the ghost by the front of the main tent. Tom made a little speech like the hero of a play, giving away his coin in a bum melodrama. As he walked away, a voice from the rear shouted, 'I have half a mind to take that little guy and punch his block off.' The whites of Tom's eyes rolled in the shade. 'I'd like to see any man of your fighter strip,' he yelled, as he...",

    text: "THE LAST TRIUMPH OF \"JEM\" MACE\n\nThe Fighter Who Dominated the Ring for Ten Years Came Back for the Third Time When Near the Age of Forty and Revived Clean Sport\n\n\"JEM\" MACE\n\n\"Jem\" Mace in Fighting Costume.\n\nAfter John Morrissey withdrew, the best claim to the American title was \"Joe\" Coburn, who defeated \"Mike\" McCool in 1863. In the following year, Coburn was to have fought with \"Jem\" Mace, then holder of the world's title for the second time, in Ireland. The unsportsmanlike conduct of Coburn, or his backers, broke up the match and left Mace with the honors. Mace's position was further strengthened when \"Joe\" Wormald forfeited a belt to him, which he had won from Andrew Marsden, and when he beat \"Joe\" Goss in 1866. Mace retired.\n\nThe scene of the big fights then shifted definitely to America, where for several years indecisive battles and counterclaims confused the issue of the championship. Several so-called championship fights were mere wrangles; others were little more than conflicts between rowdy partisans armed with knives and pistols. Fair examples of the two varieties were \"Ned\" O’Baldwin’s \"victory\" over \"Joe\" Wormald in 1868, and \"Mike\" McCool's \"triumph\" over \"Tom\" Allen in 1869. Finally, in 1870, \"Jem\" Mace came out of his retirement and obtained a match with \"Tom\" Allen, the best available boxer in the American ring.\n\nIt was an enthusiastic gathering that filled the special train out of New Orleans on May 10, 1870, bound for the spot where the championship of the world was to be decided once more. Not since the great international contest between Heenan and Sayers had the pugilistic world looked so hopefully toward a promised test of skill, or given proof so notably of its faith in the possibility of lifting the game from reproach. \"Jem\" Mace, latter-day exponent of the manly science developed by its masters Mendoza and Belcher, had come to America and had been matched with \"Tom\" Allen for $2,500 and the world's title.\n\nMace was in every way the veteran of the profession. He was thirty-nine years old. As a youth, he had been an itinerant instructor in boxing. Before his two meetings with \"Tom\" King, in 1862, he had been prominent in the ring for seven years. He had fought thrice as many pitched battles as any other man who then flew colors within the \"squared circle.\" His circuit had included England, Ireland, Australia, and America. And now, well past the boxer's prime, with an established and honorable record, he volunteered to restore the ancient traditions of the sport after a period of confusion and disorder by one more honest test of manhood.\n\nAllen was the fittest opponent to dispute the great fighter. Born in Birmingham in 1841, he had the advantage over Mace by ten years. His career in the ring had been busy and successful, including a dozen fights before his departure from England and four in this country. A meeting with \"Mike\" McCool near St. Louis the preceding year had been broken up by a mob, and he had lost the decision after leading all the way; but subsequent negotiations for another trial with McCool had ended with the withdrawal of the nominal champion, and Allen was now in actual possession of the title.\n\nThe special, after an early start, proceeded to a stretch of open ground some three miles above Kennerville, La., where the ring was pitched near the river. The crowd of one thousand, which included many well-known fight followers from all parts of the country and from abroad, army officers, and the members of the Chicago Baseball Club, ranged in orderly manner about the ropes. Mace and Allen, who had followed the train on a dummy engine, were called forward by Rufus Hunt, the referee, and entered the ring with their attendants for a general handshaking. Mace was seconded by \"Jim\" Cusick and \"Jerry\" Donovan, and Allen by \"Joe\" Coburn and Sherman Thurston.\n\nAt the stepping both men showed in magnificent condition, proof of long and faithful training. The spectators dwelt curiously and admiringly upon the wonderful physique of Mace, his trim, muscled, knotted figure, his brisk, lithe movements. The old champion, full of the pride of body, had never allowed himself to get out of hand and revealed none of the softened lines and flabby rolls which might have been pardoned for his age. His skin was fresh and firm upon the whipping ridges, his pose as erect and easy as when he first snatched the championship. And with it all was the calm, youthful, confident smile that had overlooked so many stricken fields. He came there at 165 pounds, just seven pounds over his weight in his prime.\n\nAllen was a being of hard, angular, powerful build, five feet ten inches high, overtopping Mace by two inches. Trained just before the fight, he weighed in at 173 pounds. His natural weight was 180, and the loss of the extra gave a gaunt, bony look to his heavy frame and muscular arms. His chest development was unusually good, high and arched. He lacked the symmetry and fine proportions of the veteran, but every inch was solid, strong, and able.\n\nAt the call of time, the men moved forward slowly to the center of the twenty-four-foot ring, and their hands met for an instant in the final handshake, from which they whipped instantly on guard. Mace fell away with springy tread, studying his adversary, alert to every line of his attitude, every slightest indication of strength or weakness. Then, advancing a cautious step, he slid easily into the tapping spar and whirl of fists with which he was wont to test his man.\n\nAllen met him speedily and well, though it was not in him to show the grace and deftness of the veteran. He was one trained to a rough-handed school of pugilism that had put aside many of the fine, scientific tactics of the art in favor of hard blows and tough bodies. In this, \"Tom\" presented an ideal contrast to Mace, survivor of the third great period of fistic history, which produced, besides himself, such strategists as Sayers and King. Allen stood sturdily on his own ground, playing only enough to cover himself and was watchful of the chance to hammer through with his heavy fists. Mace was here, there, and around, circling, weight poised for advance or retreat, handling himself like the fast, compact, adjustable fighting machine he was.\n\nArms and bodies flashed swiftly, silently, as the gladiators feinted and parried in their preliminary clash, constant applause from the eager spectators testifying to the keen interest aroused by the skillful exhibition. Then, with characteristic suddenness, Mace moved in with a quick shuffle and swept over a stinging left to the right eye, stopped Allen's quick drive with sure judgment, and repeated the blow to the nose before springing back. Allen's retaliatory swing passed him harmlessly, and he was once more at his chosen distance, balanced, tense for any move. The slower Allen now showed a disposition to even scores and broke in a rush, driving right and left. \"Jem\" warded both blows aggressively, met the charge with a side step, smashed a straight left to the ribs that stopped Allen dead in mid-career, and got away with his customary grin.\n\n\"Tom,\" it was evident, had no preconceived plan of campaign, and having been checked, fell back upon the sparring once more, hopeful of drawing Mace within range. \"Jem\" met him in some rapid, light exchanges, pressing craftily on. Allen was awake to his chance, and lashed out sharply with right and left, tapping the veteran. Mace ducked the volley, worked in, and shot his famous one-two to the left eye and chin, like a compound flash of lightning. Those among the watchers who had seen him in former days knew that it was indeed the spectacular \"Jem\" Mace of old as he went through this maneuver. If there was one thing more than another in Mace's style that marked him a master, it was his ability to get through a double smash and get away again in the space of a wink. He had not lost his cunning, and \"Tom\" Allen could only wonder dazedly, as many another had done, how and whence the blows had come.\n\nBut \"Tom's\" chief concern was to make some adequate reply, and he rushed again, whirling his powerful arms. He bore upon \"Jem,\" beat down his guard with a crushing left pound, and thrashed out a right swing that caught Mace high on the head and sent him staggering. The veteran was equal to the crisis. As Allen came on, set for more work, \"Jem\" ducked, ran in unexpectedly, slugged shrewdly about the body, planted a neat back heel, and hurled the heavier man over for a crashing, full-length fall, while the crowd broke into wild cheering.\n\nThe old champion’s visitations had had a roseate effect upon the broad face of Allen, who came to the scratch for the second round with \"Jem's\" signature written all over him. \"Tom\" was plainly minded to change the state of affairs and pulled a serious frown as he flung up his guard. Mace was as chipper as a sparrow and twice as active. He approached his man, feinted rapidly at half a dozen points, got Allen twisted up in knots with an effort to follow him, and slipped away in time. \"Tom\" shook his head and set himself in misplaced determination, and stood slowly after his man. Mace landed first, Allen left open in a move and “Jem” circled him and kept pulling back sharply with a swift side step. He then smacked through a smacking left to the shoulder and Allen’s sole chance was to force his man at the end of his fists, and he liked it well, jamming into where Mace ought to have been with right and left for repeaters. But \"Jem\" was away and light rallying was again in order. As they sparred, \"Tom\" thought better of his earlier irritation and they chaffed each other merrily as the hands flew and the session warmed.\n\nAllen suddenly brought up his reserves and hurled himself into a charge, slamming right and left. Mace was off and away, but \"Tom\" pursued tenaciously, warding two swings and launching a left drive that \"Jem\" just stopped. Again Allen let go his left, getting over the veteran's guard and planting neatly to the neck with a force that drove the lighter man clear away. Mace had no intention of fighting on the defensive and came right back, meeting Allen's rush knee to knee, flashing through his one-two to the nose and the mouth, drawing back, smashing in again to chest and ribs. He was a thought too belligerent and threw himself beyond recovery by the last blow. Allen was quick to take the chance and hooked around a short shoulder jolt to the side of the head that set things dancing for Mace.\n\n\"Tom\" forced on, close after his man, driving right and left to the body and slamming with a wicked left swing that Mace shrunk around in clever style. Allen was still on the move and let go another left, bringing his guard over too far. In a flash, Mace had popped in, taking the midarm of the swing, and a wild, jamming right to the face, while he smashed a terrific left clip to the right eye. It was pretty fighting in the mix-up, both boring for the body at deadly range and snapping short jabs to the ribs. Allen failed to ram an uppercut through but lashed a stiff drive to the body as Mace, somewhat winded, tried to jump away behind a slashing cut to the nose.\n\nAllen now went upon the warpath with a vengeance and came after Mace hard, swinging and driving as \"Jem\" footed away desperately. When the big fellow was fully wound up in this manner, he was too strong and too determined to stop except at great risk, and the veteran contented himself with blocking and dodging until at a favorable instant he ran in low and sought to grip. But \"Tom\" would not have it so. He brought both fists down on his man, jammed him away, and landed hard on the side of the head. Mace was forced, willy-nilly, into sharp resistance, and as Allen came on, he sprang to meet him with sudden fury, slashing one-two to either side of \"Tom's\" face and drawing crimson plentifully.\n\nStill, Allen wanted trouble and still he kept coming, driving Mace from stand to stand with wicked swings. \"Jem\" pranced hither and yon, elusive and fast, blocking or ducking \"Tom's\" rather wild attempts until Allen, holding to his task doggedly, slammed through a tremendous left to the ribs. \"Jem\" was stepping in at the instant and the sledgehammer met him full with crushing force. He gave, but met the issue in masterly style, leaping back at top speed with left to the right eye and right to the mouth. He was in for it now. Allen reeled a torrent of jolts and jabs, keeping his man always within distance, and finally swinging a jarring left to the neck. Mace cut him on the mouth at the same time and with mutual impulse, they stepped apart, finding the mill too hot.\n\nIt had been a terrific round, but there was more to come. Each man felt that the real test, usually developed much later in a battle, lay under their hands and that the struggle for the lead, which is so hard to reverse if once lost, must be decided before the next truce. Allen was the first to resume hostilities, rushing with a vicious left swing. Mace blocked it and broke ground when \"Tom\" lashed out a hooking drive that caught \"Jem\" painfully on the lower part of the body. Instantly, Mace's seconds were forward with cries of \"Foul!\" There was no doubt that the blow had fallen inches below the belt and the referee hesitated. But Mace, in common with all the spectators, knew that it was unintentional, and he rushed across the ring with a protesting hand before the word could be given. He refused vehemently to accept a decision on any such ground, dismissed his seconds sharply, and returned to the center, while the crowd applauded him to the echo for his sportsmanship. Allen expressed his regret and they fell to once more.\n\n\"Jem\" went into action with a rush, leaping in and getting one-two to either cheek. Allen pounded him severely to the ribs and as Mace broke, pushed after him, whaling a smashing right swing, and catching \"Jem\" high to the side of the head. This blow, which he seemed able to get over \"Jem's\" guard with good success, lost its effectiveness through poor aim. It was Allen's best move and he repeated it at intervals throughout the battle. If he could have brought it down, he would have battered \"Jem's\" face to a pulp. As it was, he punished his own knuckles on the veteran’s hard head with little inconvenience to Mace. After a brief short-arm rally, they stood apart again before whirling back with renewed vigor.\n\n\"Jem\" now tightened his speed to the last notch and threw himself into the old whirlwind pace in a bold, aggressive effort to bring the searing second round to a close, crashing through the blow hard and stung his left to the cheek. Displaying cold defiance, his man still with, Allen's, still snapping wildly, and let out repeatedly with his left, playing it like a whiplash across \"Tom's\" face. Six times in as many seconds he got through that slashing left and when he was done, Allen's face was sliced to ribbons. The last delivery, which had all of the wonderful fighter's weight behind it, caught \"Tom\" full over the left eye, whirling him back off his balance. The big fellow stood a minute, weaving and waving his arms, then fell, ending one of the most brilliant and difficult rounds in which Mace had ever taken part.\n\nBoth men were exhausted by their extended struggle and came slowly to the center for the third round. Allen had suffered fearfully about the face. His right eye was almost gone, his left was little better, and he was covered with gashes. Mace was marked on the head and welted and swollen about the body. They sparred a moment, when \"Jem\" leaped in with a hard drive to \"Tom's\" left eye. Allen footed away fast and Mace, carried by his own impetus, was yanked off his feet and dropped. The fourth session was equally brief, both sparring for wind until Mace slammed one-two to nose and mouth and fell.\n\nSomewhat restored by the lull in the wearing pace, the men came together for more real work in the fifth round. Allen especially seemed strong and anxious to regain the upper hand. He led off handily with his left, grazing \"Jem's\" ribs as the other sidestepped and countered with a neatly placed, smacking blow to the jaw. Mace then changed his ground and circled, blocking two more tentative hits until he found his angle and leaped forward with a reaping drive to the nose. \"Tom\" timed him perfectly and smashed a tremendous left-hander. But once again his aim was bad and what might have been a settler to the face struck solidly against the left shoulder, doing no harm, though it sent Mace spinning back across the ring like a manikin on wires.\n\n\"Jem\" had here a convincing demonstration of what might well happen to him if Allen should chance to place such a shot where it would count, and developed a sudden strain of caution. He held off at safe range for some minutes, feinting and sparring and drawing \"Tom\" into several futile rushes. Allen drove twice at the body, but \"Jem\" kept off until, as they circled, he crept past another hard drive and planted a stinging rap flush to the nose. As he came on with a swift rattle of blows in usual style, he tripped on his own spikes and fell heavily, but was up again instantly, refusing to end the round.\n\nAllen, aware of his adversary's new tendency to play safe, now went determinedly on the offensive and charged, reaping a stiff one to the ribs. Mace turned in from it, took a ramming short arm to the face, and clipped prettily below the left eye. \"Tom\" pounded him hard to the body and pressed on, milling and forcing \"J",
    summary: "Jem Mace, aged 39, emerged from retirement to challenge Tom Allen for the world title in 1870, aiming to restore boxing's honor amid chaotic pugilistic conditions."
