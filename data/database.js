    text: "A LOST SENSATION.\n\n: ’ »\nMike McCoole Matches Tom Allsa of\nWis Friends Prevail Upon Wine 10 With-\n\ndraw,\n—_—\n\nOn Saturday night Mike McCoole, “Champion of\nAmerica,” was matched to fight Tom Allen, of Eag-\nland, for one thousand dollars, on the 17th 07 March.\nThe agreement was signed, the preliminirios ar-\nranged and a forfeit of $150 put up. The whole affair\ntranspired at Loones’s, after the sparring at the ex-\nhibition on Saturday night. The triends of McCoole\nwere surprised to find him taking a risk so soon be-\nfore meeting Joe Coburn. A conversation between\none of his friends and himself, which transpired yes-\nterday morning, will better explain the whole thing\nthan we cando ft. McCoole had just come ontot a\nbarber's shop, when he was accosted and the foliow-\n= ensued : >\n\n3 end If you fight Tom Allen I hope yoa will zet\nwhipped.\n\nMcCoole—Thank yon. Take something.\n\nFriend—You can't fight him and get ready for the\npe with Coburn. Who knows meg about\nAllen in this country? It is no honor to whip him.\nFight the grees Tycoon, Coburn, and let this man\nwait for his time.\n\nMcCoole—1 have a of time to whip two of\nthem, and then train for the Coburn fight.\n\nFriend—But — don’t want to catch all the pig-\neons in a week ; if vou do there will be more to catch\nCn gous\n\n“oo tend to catch all the pi one\nweek, and the next I mean togoa shin.”\n\nAnd MeCoole positively refused to withdraw from\nthis fight, which was pee to take place within\n60 miles of St. Louis, a week from to-morrow (March\n17), We learn that the thing grew out of little ani-\nmosity which sprang up between MeCoole and Allen\non Saturday night. Had this yf true. coupled\nwith the fact that the men would have entered the\nring without training, the fight would doubtless have\nproved a desperate ono.\n\nAllen is himself a large, well-built man, and his\nEnglish friends offered tobet heavily on him. It was\nintimated to MeCoole that he had been sent here ex-\npressly to unfit him for the Coburn fight. McCoole\nSAE a and said “So much the better; if they\nwant to put up a job on me, let them have it.”\n\nDuring the whole of the day, yesterday, this mat-\nter was a subject of general discnssion upon the street\namong certain classes. All sorts of surmises were\nindulged in, among others the conjecture that the\naffair was a fraud, gotten up for a speculation. This\nwas contradicted by numerous facts. MeCoole, so\nfar as his record shows, has never loaned his name to\na humbug of any kind. Whenever he has fought, he\nhas fought towhip. Besides, it is positively as-\nserted by these who onght to know, that he has had\nhis “Irish” aroused, and that nothing short of draw-\ning the “ruby” will satisfy him.\n\nIn the exhibition, Satarday night, the set-to be-\ntween McCoole and Ryall was pleasing and gracetal.\nThey both smiled continually. By mere accident,\nhowever, their heads came in contact, and a slight\nabrasion was made just above MeCoole’s left aye.\nThey left the stage on the best of terms. In the wind-\nup, the set-to between McCoole and Allen was i\nacterized by a determination and earnestness seldom\nwitnessed in a friendly contest. The abrasion\non  McCoole’s forehead was opened -afresh,\nand he bled profusely. The friends of the\nother party also assert that he bled at\nthe nose, but this is denied. a from the an-\ndience cried “Stop!” They both threw their gloves\nupon the stage, and, without corny Spm. which\nis customary, retired. This covers the case as near- |\nIy 2s it can well be done.\n\nRyall and Allen are both unknown here. They\nhave been in the city but a few weeks. Yetws hear |\nEnglish-American citizens speak vauntingly of |\nwhat Allen has accomplished in the old country.\nThis, no doubt, intensified MeCoole's desire to meet | |\nhim.\n\nThe excitement continned all day, and dologa-\ntions of McCoole’s friends were constantly waiting\non him. At last he vielded to their wishes, upon the | |\nassurance that he was submitting them to a riskas | |\nwell as himself, as they had money staked upon\nhim. A eard in another part of this paper explains\nhis position. He is willing to fight Allen for 32,500\nninety days after oe my with Coburn, and is ready\nto put up 5500282 forfeit. Nothing can be more de-\nfinite than his proposition.\n\nThe exbibition on Saturday night, in which many\nag, as rms was a complimentary testimonial\nto Ryall Allen, and was pr attended, Me-\nCoole volunteered and appeared twice during the\nevening, which he rarely does for his best friends.",

M. Davis, of Califor-\n* | nia, and Thomas Allen, of Cleveland, for $1,000 a\n\"| side. The men have been in active training for\n| gome time past. Bill Davis has been out at Pat\n| Doyle's “Cresent City Exchange” at the Fair\n+ | Grounds, undergoing a rigid system of training un-\n| der the mantpulation of Bill Blake alias “Dablin\n. | Tricks.” The late assault on him and the injuries\nreceived therefrom do not militate against his fight-\n\ning status. It was rumored, it was a plot of the\n\"| enemy to disable him, snd render him unfit\n\nfor the contest. Other rumors were afloat in regard\n| to the matter, which even went to the ears of the\n| New York Clipper, to whom Bill gives this version\n- | of the story:\n\n1) — please to allow me 0 in\nour columns ope pt Taras bedors the pestle,\n| by giving a correct account of the affray in which I\n\nwas engaged on Christmas day. T had Just finished\n\n: my dinner and was & ery for my atternoon\nwalk, when a man I had never sesn in my\n, | 1fe struck me a blow from behind, on the kidneys.\nEE So aes\ng IEF and right agai at my head. 1 dodged back and\n_ | escaped, spc ES a I\nhe feli, and, in the heat of pa:sion, I kicked him\nonce. After ry him up and washed him\n| be came to me tr png pm\n| assanlted me, saying it was all a mistake. I to\n| him I did pot know him, and it must a RA\njob; but, as a matter of course, I excused him, an\n, | so the matter ended for the time. I wentont tormy\nwalk with Bill Blake, alias “Dublin Tricks,” m\n\"| trainer, and when I returned the man whom i\n- | bad the difficulty with was still in the bar room,\n| with five or six others, all armed, and who\nhad shown thelr weapons to the proprietor of tha\n- | house, Mr. Doyle, threatening to kill me on sight.\ndir. Doyle and others paid mo attention to their\nthreats, thinking they were made in drunken brag-\n3 ee When I came in the man whom I bad the\nfa eget my anton tn: T Se Satie wos Bo\nor iu hus Sant kept a sharp look out. He tried\n| to drag me to him as we shook hands, when a small-\ner man stepped between us, and, without a word,\n| made a plunge at my stomach with a knife thirteen\n> | or tourteen inches long. I jumped back and struck\nthe big fellow and the little one almost simulta-\n| reeusly, with my walking stick, knocking them\n| down. Almost at the same moment another man\nstrock at me sideways, and, as luck would have it,\n. | I saw the blow quick enough 10 ward it off, but in\n| doing so cut my wrist slightly. I was takeh so\nmuch by surprise by the onslaught, that I got into\n\na passion and ran up stairs to arm myself. Whea I\n\nwas fixed, the proprietor of the houses, with several\n\nothers, had the doors clozed, so I could not get in,\n\notherwise the damage might have been serions.\nYours, respectfully, WM. M. DAVIS.\n\nAt all events, Bill is now over his injuries, in good\ntrim, and confident of an sasy victory. He is now\ndown to 175 pounds, fighting weight, having ex-\nhaustod 25 pounds of his condition in the course\nof training. He has been declared by excellent\n“manly artists” to be in the best fighting trim\nhe has ever been in. His backers are alive to his\ncondition, and are betting tall odds upon him.\n\nTom Allen's arrival was announced a few days\nage. He went out on the Gravois road, some nine\nmules from the city, in training, under the manage-\nment of Tom Kolly, a manipulator of no mean re-\npute. Allen Is rather fleshy, but a hard course of\ntraining is fast bringing him into proper fighting\ntrim. His friends, and they are many, go out almost\ndally to witness him among his sand-bags and\ndumb-bells. They speak very confidently of Allen's\n\n| ability to “punish” Davis in the coming contest,\nard are belting liberally on him.\n\nMike McCosle and Bill yall, the big-guns of the\n| prize ring, have, we understand, chartered the\n| steamer “Tom Stevens,” to take (he pugilists\n|| and their friends to the field of battle. We\n'| learn that there is a second boat charterad outside\n|| of the party to speculate on excursionists to the\n\nscene of the encounter.\n\nThe tickets for the fight are already issued at 85\neach, and are, in sporting parlance, “going off like\nhotcakes.” Theyare to be bad only at Mike Me-\nCoole’s and Bill Ryall's. The party will leave before\n7o'clock Tuesday morning, when the scene, referee,\nseconds and other P. R. officials will be chosen. It\nis emphatically anuouneed that mo person will be\nallowad on board with weapons of any description.\nA thorough search will be made, and not even a\npocket knife will be permitted.\n\nThe inner ring, to which the contestants alone are\nalowed, will be twenty-four foet square. The mid-\nale ring will be under charge of Frank\nCurry, and will be allotted to tha ses-\nonde, the referee, the members of the press\nand those of the attendants who have no\nob ection to pay $2 more for the privilege. The\nthurd and outer ring Is for the general spe:tators. It\nis reported there will be 2 good band of music in at-\ntendance.\n\nAmong the constellation of champlon fizhtists in\nthe city are the following stars: Mike McCoole and\nBill Byall, Tom Riley and Young Ryan, Jack\nLooney and Tom Kehoe, Bill Davis, of Califor-\nnia, and Tom Allen, of Cleveland ; Charlie Gallagher\nthe “Cleveland Boy,” and Jim Elliott, of Detroit;\n“Baflalo Bill,” alias Hanley; Mike Ryan, of Cleve-\nland; Barney Frayne, of Kentucky; +im Haliornan,\nof Cleveland; Tom Kelley, Allen's tratmer; El,\nSeward, the “Cleveland Pet;” Tom McAlpine, alias\n“Soap ;” Mike ard Jerry Donovan, of Chicago, and a\nbost of 0 hers.\n\nANOTHER FIGHT.\n\nBome time ago Chas. C. Gallagher and Jim Plliott\nhed a prize-fight on Peach Island, near\nI troit, when most foul play was shown\nto Gallagher and Elliott's friends claimed the fight.\nThis gave rise to a spirited controversy in the New\nYork Clizper, which called out Gallagher in his\nown defence, who says he is not a beaten man, and\nrenews his chailenze for 2,000 a side and sends to\nthe editor ot the Clipper $50 to prove that he meant\n+biz.” He is now willing to fight Jim Elliott for\nany amount from five cents to §2,000 and not ask a\nday’s preparation. Goaded by this offer, wa under-\nstand, although there are two St. Louis injunctions\naguninst Jim, that he reached the city on Friday\nevening and is under cover, undergoing a thorough\nsystem of trang, to meet Gallagher in the Davis-\nAllen ricg and “pony up™ $590 tor his side. On\naccount ot Ellioit’s peculiar relations to\nthis city, the thing is being done up\nvery quietly and coosiderable money is\nbeing staked om the result. Rumor has it\nthat he makes Rethschila’s Sportsman’s Hall his\nheadquarters. The English prize-ring book, with\nthe heights, weights and fights of every pugilist in\nthe world 1s to Le found there.\n\nA THIRD FIGHT.\n\nItis understood mong the sporting fraternity\nthat a light-weight fight 18 alse to come off in the\nDavis-Allen ring on Tuesday, botween Geo.

Davis, of California,\n\na and Tom Allen, of Cleveland. Betting was not very\n\nr | brisk, the odds being nearly all in favor sf Tom Allen.\n\n~ | Songs, jokes, toasts to the “winning man” and the\n\n1 “best man\" were programmes extemporlzed for the\n\nt | occasion inthe various houses frequented by the\n“fancy.” Even the softer sex got somewhat enthu-\n\n¥ | sinstic over the fight and the prospects of Its results.\n\nThey were ambitious to see the prowess of the\n\no> | enclent gladiators emulated by the “scioatific”\n\nH pogihists of modern days. All the houses in the\n\npn | city, peculiarly dedicated to the god of sport, wers\n\ne | duxing the night crowded to overflowing.\n\n» From an early hour In the morning, or rathsr for\n\n. the most part of the night, not only were the sa-\n\n¢ | loouvs, but the boat “Henry Adkins,” a scene of pe-\n\n» | culiar liveliness. Towards daylight a portion of the\n\n~ | Levee was crowded with speciators, who, if they\n\nn | did't come to see the fight, came to see who did.\n\ny It wasa delightful morning. The sun rose in ma-\n\n= | Jestic splendor on the broad waters of the Mississip-\n\n» | pi, as the Henry Adkins’ shrill whistle sounded the\n\n- | signal for starting.\n\nt| Streams of men began to pouron to the boat, as\nche lay at the foot of Green street, trom an early\n\n8 | bour.

    text: "THE PRIZE FIGHT. |\n—_—\nA Brief but Exciting Mill\nCharlie Gallagher Whips Tom Allen in Two\nRounds and in Three Minutes.\nOne Terrific Blow Settles the Business.\nThe “Fancy” Surprised—Incidents of\nthe Day—The Betting, &c.\n\nYesterday, amid the snow and chilly breezes of\nthe morning, the lovers of pugilism turned outin\nconsiderable force for attendance at the fight to take\nplace between Charles C. Gallagher and Thomas\nAllen, both of Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nThe men and their condition and position have\nalready been described in these columms. Charlie\nGallagher is a mere boy of 23 years of age, 6 feet 1}\n\n| inches in height, and a comparative novice in the\nplize-ring. Tom Allen is about 30 years of age, 5\n\ntoot 10 inches in height, and claims to be the Paglish\n\n| champion ot the prize-ring.\n\n| THE START.\n\nAt wine o'clock, at the foot of Washington avenue,\n\nthe “Gem” was receiving passengers for an excursion\n\ntrip to the scene of battle. Within a square or two,\n\ntho “Galatea” was recoiving the friends and backers\n\nof Tom Allen, and seemed to run mn opposition to\n\ntke “Gem.” The “Gem” was specially crowded\n\nwith the lovers of the “manly art.” The “Galatea”\nkad a very small and, no doubt, select cargo.\n\n~ Amongike nofabilities of the sporting fraternity\npresent were the following, whose names we give\nfur the enlightenment of posterity:\n\nMike McCoole, John Lyoney, Tom Kehoe, J.\nHickey, Patsey Curtin, Dan Stevens, Pat Wali,\nPete Brooks, Pat Hanlon, Mike Ryan, Geo. Looney,\nTim Halloran, Ike Campbell, Chas, E. Dobson,\nFraok Curry, E. Dufly, Fred Watkins, Tom.\nCurtis, Edwin O'Donnell, of Chicago; James\nHealy, John Phillips, of Binghamton, New York;\nBiily Carroll, Jim Shannon, Sherman Thurston,\nDad Kvan, Bob Collins, Dave Hoye, Pat Connallin,\nYoung Dago, Pat Reardon, Young Clifford, Phila.;\n\n\"RB. B. Baker, Cin ; Frank Roche, Cin.; Tom Ryan,\nCir.; Joe Ferry, Cin.; Barney Frain, Covington,\n\n~ Ky.; and many other lesser lights.\n\nLt was about 10 o'clock when the Gem, with hor\n“precious” cargo, toddled up the stream to Bis-\n\n~ »0ll’s Point, where the Galatea took Tom Allen on\n\nboard, to the sound of some shouting. The woats\n\nthen wonded their way down the stream, for the\nscene of action. McCoole and a few others Icft the\nbeat at Blssell's Point, in what many on board\nwould .eall “disgust.” 1be beat remalmed at the\n“Point” a long time, and, at an adjacent store, the\nboys belped themsclves to beer, crackers, cheese,\nand 8 variety of other creature comforts, on which\nthe proprietor made shim profits.\n\nOn board the boat were a variety of gawes of\nchance—called chuck-luck, red-and-black, reven-up,\ndice and five or six others that are known ondy to\nthe mitlated.\n\n1tiwould be a rich subject for a novelist ora philoso-\npher to study the crowd gathered on the lazy hoards\nof the “Gem.” There were fighters trom all parts\nof tbe continent, and persons of all classes of\nsociety. A motley throng suilmated by the spirit of\n\nthe barbaric amusement in prospect.\n\nAt Carondelet the “Gem” took Charlie Gallagher\n\non board, and he was coralally received by his\nfriends.\n\n| THE SCENE OF THE FIGHT,\n\n~The project was to go dewn the river te some\n\n| spotoffering a suitable scene for the contest. Car-\n\n~ roil’s Island was selected as the scene of the en-\ncounter. It is situated about one mile below\n\nQuarantine, and is well wooded, and enlivened by\n\na few shanties and log cabins.\n\nOn this island, in a clearing in the woods, a ring”\nwae improvised, according to the regulations of the\nBritish prize-ring. The ground was a littl» uneven\nard had to be leveHed. The snow lay thick and heavy\nall around, but the genial sun shone out as brightly\n\nas if on a camp meeting.\n\n| PRELIMINARY MATTERS.\n\n| Tom Allen chose for hus umpire Daa Ryan. Char-\n\nlie Gallagher chose for his Jimmie McDonnell; bat\nthe great difficulty was the selection of a reteree.\n\nCharlie Gallagher was the first in the ring,\n\nand shied his castor to . intimate that he\nwas “on hand.” Soon afier Tom Alien arrived, and\nthe fightists were comfortably wrapt in blankets.\nBeth of them looked tresh, physically and mentally\n\nAfter» hundred names were proposed and dis-\ncussed for referee 1t was—at or near 5 P. M.—sgreed\nthat Messrs. Kearney and Judd should act in the\ncapacity.\n\nCharlie Gallagher flourished a “C* that Allen\n| promptly took up, and then Ailen tried to bluff the\ntriends of Gallagher by offering $10) even, 100 to\n~ 90, 100 to 80, and he hallooed very loualy for 100 to\n\n70, which was ultimately returned to Mr. Walker,\nthe treasurer for the occasion.\n\nOn a “toss np” for a choice of corners, Gallagher\nhappened to be the lucky man, and turned his back\nto the setting sun. The fighters were ready—only\nto divest them of their toggery and prepare for the\ninper ring. The ring was neatly prepared, the ar-\nrangements being conducted by the tollowing com-\nmittee: Frank Curry, Barney Frayne, Mike Salli-\nvan, Wm. Fitzgibbons, Tom Riley, Pat Hanley, Pat\nReilly, the “dead boxer,” Bob Collins, J:m Hotlor-\nan, Fd. Robinson, Josh Shaw, Billy Dago, Mike\nRyan, Jim Shaovon, Denny Daniels, Jun Kearney\nHennessy, Pat Rowen, and others.\n\nFrank Curry deserves eredit for instituting the\npractice of Proviamg seats for the reporiers in the\n“ioner ring.” Yesterday they were provided with\nchairs, and everything done to facilitate their opera-\nNe THE FIGHT,\n\nPatsy Reardon and Jack Looney were the seconds\nof Tom Allen; Patsy Curtin and “Dablin Tricks’\nmanipulated Charlie Gallagher. Pete Brooks acted\nas ring-mauster.\n\nIt was nearly five o'click when the referees were\nchosen, and the “men” declared themselves ready\nfor the “tun.” |\n\nRound 1—DBetting ran high and seemed to be in\nfavor of Allen, who looked confident of an easy vic-\ntory. The men came to the call of “time” with\nmuch determination. Gallagher was more cool |\nthan we conid insglie be would be. Allen huda |\ngay sardonic smile on his bandsom e Enghsh phiz as |\nhe measured his opponent. They played around a |\nlittle, and a right-bander from Gallagher drew first |\nblcod trom Allen’s upper lip. Soon after a eliccher |\nfrom Allen's right mauler sent the ruby flowing\ntrom Gallagher's proboscis. There were several |\n“handsome” right and left thrusts on both sides,\nand a clip trem Allen, axded by a slip, brought Gal-\nlagher tothe surface of the earth. First knock\ndown claimed for Allen.\n\nRound 2 and last—The men came to the call of\ntime with great prowptitude. Allen dealt Galiagher\na tipon the nczzle that sent the carmime over Gal-\nlagher’s frontispicce amd inspired him to exert\nhimself. Then Gallagher, quick a3 lightuing,\ngive Allen a left-hander on the chest, and,\nas Allen dodged bis bead, a right-hander\nLebird the ear that knocked the champion senseless\nbeyond the ropes. His head lay outside the ring,\nard the first impression was that Alien was killed.\nHe bad to be carried to his corner, and was com-\npletely knocked out of time and tune. Restoratives\nhad to be applied with some energy m order to rc.\nstore him, and his greatest opponents were glad to |\ns8e signs of veturning life.\n\nThis ended the fight, and Charlie Gallagher\nwas declared tbe victor, and his chosen\ncolor, the green, was flaunted amid deafening cheers.\n\nAfter Tom Allen's revival there was some talk of\nhis rechallenging Gallagher for $5,000 a side, but\nnothing definite transpired.\n\nTHE RETURN.\n\nTte trip home was very animated—discussing\nthe merits ot the fight anc C. A. Donaldson's\nrefreshments, which the party did with much en-\nthusiam.\n\nThere is no doubt but the sporting fraternity\n\nwere much surprised at the issue of the fight, All\nexpected Allen to be the victor, but the blow which\nmight be called a “chance” blow, and might not ve-\ncur in « hundred fights sent Allen out of time, and\nalmost out ot the world. Allen isa man of firmly\nkn:t frame, while Gallagher is what may be consid-\ndered a mere boy as yet, and certamly not Allen's\nequal in strepzeh.\n\"No fight was even looked upon iu a national\nsense. Allen is an Englishman, snd a member of\nthe **Queen’s own,” while Gallagher 1s a genuine\nFenian and bere the **(reen” as if the fate of Ire-\nland dependea on the contest. The enthusiasm\nmandtes ed ou Gallagher's victory was unbounded,\nparticntary as Allen is reported to have said he was\nErgland’s champion, ava could whip any “Irish\n&c.” this side of the Atlantic. It is even presumed\nthat it Allen kad won the fight, there would be a\nsort of an international melee around the ropes,",

    text: "————\nBOKIANA.\nSt. Lous the Fistic Centre.\nThe Night Before the Baitle—A Visit to the\nHaunts of ‘““the Fancy.”\n\n‘Whether St. Louis shall or shall not be the gov-\nernmental centre of *‘the universal Yankee nation”\nremains to be decided hereafter by the force of\nevents and the wisdom of the great American peo-\nple; but she enjoys one position already, which\nnone of her rivals dare dispute. St. Louis is the fistic\ncentre of the Republic, beyond all question. Here\nare gathered the creme de la creme of pugilistic soci-\nety; the pick and flower of modern gladiators; the\nbright, particular stars, whose orbit is in the twenty-\nfour-foot ring; the best illustrators of “the manly\nart of self-defence;” the men who ‘go in on their\nmuscle” as a profession, and hammer one another\ninto bloody jelly purely as a matter of business—in\nshort, the chiefs of the neble army of “buffers” are\n\n| within our borders. St. Louis has an almost exclu-\nsive monopoly of these unblushing honors, and wears\nthem as gracefully as she can under the circum-\nstances.\n\nJohn Morrissey, once the pet and pride of the New\nYork “fancy,” has fallen from his high estate, and\ndwindled into a mere member of Congress; Heenan,\nthe gallant youth from Benicia, strikes no more from\nthe shoulder, but bets judiciously, and wins fre-\nquently on trotting horses and voracious “tigers;\nJoe Coburn has departed into unknown regions,\nand the rest of the illustrious ex-pounders\nare so entirely forgotteh that we need not\nannounce their names or whereabouts. But while\nthe remainder of the country cannot boast of a single\nchampion, we have no less than three of them—each\nready and willing to wear the belt, or to\n“belt” one another at the slightest provocation.\nAllen, Gallagher and McCoole are permanent resi-\ndents and permanent attractions; they mix with or-\ndinary mortals on terms of perfect equality, and dis-\npense facial and liquid “smiles” over their respect-\nive bars ata low price for cash, or approved secu-\nrity.\n\nThe presence of these burning and shining lights\ndraws a multitude of the smaller fry, who flutter\naround the champions like moths around a candle.\n\nAnd each champion has his own particu’ar set of\nretainers, men who pat him on the back, shout his\npraises, drink his whiskey and make themselves use-\nful and ornamental generally.\n\nThe “chafing” and “blowing” of these fellows\nfurnish the electric atmospbere J, generates\nmatches—for all matches are not in heaven,”\nwhile those we allude to emanate from an en-\ntirely different locality.\n\nAllen's friend tells Gallagher's friend that the for-\nmer can whip the latter. Gallagher hears of it, de-\nnies the soft impeachment, &e., &c., until both\nhaving screwed their courage to the fighting\npoint, a challenge is offered and accepted, the pre-\nliminaries are arranged, the money put up, the box-\ners go inte training, and at the appointed time the\nwhole culminates in “a merry miil,”” like the one ex-\npected to-day.\n\n‘When the fight is thoroughly cooked and ready to\nbe served up hot, the distinguished guests from\nabrcad begin to arrive; never standing on etiquet.e,\nor waiting for an invitation, but just stepping in\n“like one of the family,” and making themselves\nentirely at home. Consequently the twelve or\ntwenty-four hours previous to a battle isapt to be\nsoinewhat exciting and brilliant. There is a sort of\nIreemasonry among prize-fighters, ani they all\nseem to know each other by “grips” as well as pass-\nwords. No introduction is ever needed; oue o. these\n\ngame-cocks walks into a saloon where game-cocks\ncongregate, gives a preliminary crow. asks the crowd\nup to drink, and ‘be thing is done without ceremony\nor cards. £55,\n\nEvery train yesterday brought in a delega‘ion of\nthe P. R. fraternity. They are a curious breed, and\nthe student of human nature who has never studied\ntheir habits has yet very much learn if hot to enjoy.\nWhat quantities of active, belligerent, original sia is\nwrapped up in these unregensrate bodies we do not\ncare to inquire, but the bodies certainly are models\nfor a sculptor. Strip yonder swaggering ruffian of his\nclothes, and he would show like the Apollo Belvi-\ndere. If bebe in good condition, or “in fighting\ntrim,” as it is called, not an ounce of sup=rfluous\nflesh encumbers his bones. The massive neck sits\nfirm and strong upon the broad shoulders; the limbs\n\ntaper toward the extremities as cleanly and perfectly\nas those of a thorough-bred horse, and beneath\nthe marble skin the mnet-work of muscle rise\nand falls like a piece of superb machinery. What\nsplendid sntmals they are! But their beauty ends\nwhere their heads begin. Naturally enough they aly\nLave striking countenances, but they are not pretty,\nand, we presume, do not want to be considered so.\nThere is a large preponderance of brain behind the\nears, a scanty development where the organs of ven-\neration and conscientiousness are supposed to re-\nside ; suspicious scars are scattered here and there;\nthe nose bridges bear painful evidence of having\nbeen travelled over too often, and the ivory crop is\nusually short—likewise the hair. Giving the devi)\nbis due, prize fighters are seldom quarrelsome, and\ntheir behavior on the street is rather subdued than\notherwise. To see them in their glory, one must go\nto their haunts—as we did last night. But even then\nhe must be more fortunate than we were, else his\nstock of knowledge will not be materially increased.\nOur first call was at\nTOM ALLEN'S. bd\nThis establishment is on Firth, between Biddle and\nO'Fallon streets, and the sign announces it as a\na “Concert Saloon.” The usual drinking parapher-\nnalia occupy the front, and through a narrow door\nin a low partition the visitor passes into a narrow\napartment dedicated to the worship of Bacchus\nand Calliope. A range of round tables and\nchairs are provided for the devotees of the\nformer, and a piano perched upon a platform serves\nfor those of the latter. Thus the twin deities of\nwine and music, bya convenient and satisfactory\narrangement, receive heir offerings at the same al-\ntar. The bar was lined by a thirsty and enthusias- |\ntie crowd, and the tables were also liberally patron-\nized, two or three servitors being engaged in dealing\nout the potables, and rushing hither and thither in :\nthe most frantic manner. A young mau with bright\nauburn hair presiged at the instrument and execut-\ned a terrific accompaniment to a gentleman in his\nshirt sleeves who sang a terrific song in praise of\nlager beer. At certain intervals another gentleman\nrapped on the table and the whole company burst\nforth in a tremendous chorus which made the very\nrafters tremble. The audience could not be consid-\nered strictly seiect, in fact it was miscellaneous and\nvariegated. Men with soft hats, men with beavers;\nmen with good clothes on and men whose clothes\nwere not so good; men sober as they could be, and | |\nmen not so sober as they might be; but among them | |\nall there were very few of boxiana’s upper crust. | 1\nThe nationality of those present was English, in- | 1\ntensely English, and the broai cockney dialect had a | 1\nJolin Bull-ish flavor which tasted strongly of the | «\nmother country. i\nThere was not much said about the fight, but if we | 1\nmight judge of the popular feeling a perfect confi- |\ndence was entertained in the prowess of Allen, and | «\nbis friends were too sanguine to discuss the chances, | 1\nSo we swung round to\nCHARLIE GALLAGHER’S, ¥\non Broadway. This is more spacious than its rival, | «\nbut got up on the same principles and dedicated to | ¢\nthe same purpose. A piano and a violin blended | +\ntheir discords for the benefit of the patrons, but no | }\nvocal harmonies disturbed the seremities of the\ntime and place. Square, steady drinking appeared |\nto constitute the order of exercises, but no noise or | t\nboistercus conduct was observed. Mere England ! f\nwas lost sight of, and we were to all intents and pur- | «\nposes in the heart of Ireland. Natives of ** the gem | |\nof the ocean” circulated about promiscuously, in ex- | t\ncellent humor with themsclves and everybody else, | |\nbut the approaching battle did not enter into the |\nconversation to as great am extent as might be im- | 1\nagined. Gallagher's adherents evidently preferred L\nto await the issue of the combat, and not to spoil the 1\nvictory, or intensify the defeat by any preliminary |\nboasting.\n| M'0OOLE’S\nWas as quiet and solemn as a country funeral by |\nmoenlight. Not a soul was visible, except the bar- |\nkeepers, and we sought in vain for the good-natured\n~ pliz of big Mike, but he was not to be seen by the | |\nuninitiated, and we continued cur perambulations to |\n| BILLY CARROLL'S. :\nThis saloon being adjacent to the Varieties Thea\nire is extensively frequented by the sporting gentry, ;\nLut no unusual attendance or excitement was shown :\nlast night. From the proprietor we gathered the :\nfollowing names of visitors from abroad, who intend :\nto participate in the festivities of to-day:\nBlacksmith Jim, of New York; Stake, of New |\nYork; Butt Riley, of Cincinnati; Charley Foudry, | ¢\nW. R. Cunningham, better known as “Dad Shor-\ntey,” of Buffalo; J. P. Shaw and Joe Ross, of Chica-\ngo; Henry, of New York; Barney Riley, of Buffalo;\nKnight, of Chicago; Joseph King, of Cleveland; Ed.\n0’Baldwin, the Irish Giant; Barney Fraine, of Cov-\nington, Ky., Patsey Reardon, of Springfield, Tl;\nPat Coyle, of Bloomington, Ill.; Pete Toole, Jack-\nsonville, Ill. ; George Burns, of Bloomington, Ill,\nand Pat Hanley, from the State at large.\n\nMessrs. Allen and Gallagher propose to keep them-\nselves out of sight until the ball is ready to open,\nand will probably join the steamer at some point be-\nvond the city. Both are understood to be in fine con-\ndition —much better indeed than they are likely to\nbe this ¢vening.",

    text: '\n            # M\'COOLE.\n            \n            ## A Visit to his Training Quarters.\n            ### How the Giant Looks, Acts and Feeis. \n            \n            The approaching fight between Mike McCoole and Tom Allen, to come off within fifty miles of Cincinnati, \n            on the l0th of next month, is already attract- ing the usual amount of conjectures, surmises and\n            attention at the hands of the devotees of the P.R. Judging from the tone of the Cincinnati press Allen has \n            numerous friends there, but concerning the fistic giant McCoole but little has been said. Being an advocate \n            of fair play, we yesterday paid a visit to the chieftain at his headquarters at the Fairfield House, about \n            four miles out on Grand avenue, near the Fair Ground, arriving in time to find him just emerging from his \n            customary bath after his morn- ing\'s exercise. The Fairfield House, by the way, is somewhat noted as the \n            rendezvous of professional shoulder bitters, and is kept by Mr. Frank Curry. It was here McCoole trained \n            for the Ooburn "mill," and its remoteness from the bustle of the city and healthy location are admirably \n            adapted to the work of developing muscle for the contests of the ring.\n            \n            ### THE INTERVIEW.\n             \n            Approaching from Grand avenue we had no trouble in finding the place, for above it floated a large American \n            flag, and across it in ample letters was painted " McCoole"s Headquarters-Training Ground." We walked into \n            the bar and sitting- room, and made known our business to a consumptive looking gentleman, and were \n            informed that McCoole was just closing his morning\'s exercises at the bath and would soon be in. While \n            waiting, Thomas Kelly, one of his trainers and seconds, a light built, active, pleasant fellow by the way, \n            came in, and we had just commenced that pumping process for which reporters are proverbial, when Mike "put \n            in an appearance," looking more like a sturdy, hearty farmer than the noted bruiser whose fame in that \n            line is familiar in both hemispheres. Of course we introduced ourself, commenced business, and found bim \n            by to means backward in answering questions and giving all information possible upon the subject of \n            training, health, &c. He is evideutly used to answering questions, and the replies come out directly \n            and to the point.\n            \n            ### HIS TRAINING.\n            \n            McCoole Is in charge, 80 to speak, of James Haley, a somewhat formidable knight of the P. R. by the one of \n            the and considered best trainers the country, and Mr. Thomas Kelly, mentioned before. McCoole\n            has now been in preparatory exercise for the "mill" some two months. When he commenced his weight was 248% \n            pounds, and, as he stands full eix feet in his stockings, the reader who never saw Lim can form some \n            adequate idea of his appearance. His weight now, of course, is a secret, probably known to none but \n            himself. He admits, however, that it is very hard work to reduce himself to the requisite point for work \n            in the ring, but he is being reduced, and yesterday he looked in admirable condition. His skin has that \n            healthy rosiness about it which betokens excellent health and no dissipation. Indeed, he informed us \n            that when he got ready to fight Coburn he was in as good condition as he ever was in his life, and now \n            he felt full as well as then. His trainers told us also that he was in splendid plight and daily improving. \n            \n            He sleeps on a good mattress, with plenty of warm covering, rises promptly at five o\'clock in the morning, \n            rain or shine, and immediately proceeds to a shed room on the rear of the lot, about 10x12, where he \n            exercises with the dumb-bells, a suspended sand bag weighing about four hundred pounds, cannon balls and \n            two heavy bags attached to cords running over a pully. This exercise is continued for about a half hour, \n            and is done to develop the muscles of the arm, the flesh on which now feels like buckskin stretched over \n            marble. After this he wraps himself up as warm as possible, and muffles up his face so as to be hardly \n            discernible-for the purpose of producing profuse perspiration, and starts out on his four mile walk-two \n            in and two out. Returning he takes a salt water bath, and undergoes a pretty severe scrubbing and rubbing \n            process, sufficiently rough, indeed, to take the skin off almost any other man but him. After the bath he \n            dresses warmly again and rests a while, and then breakfasts moderately on beef or mutton, with a little \n            trimmings-the meat, of course, always rare. His diet is substantial, and varies but little from that of a \n            laboring man, although, probably, he does not eat as much. After breakfast comes a rest of an hour or so, \n            or until one o\'clock, when he dons his walking shoes, each weighing about five pounds, and, accompanied \n            by one or both of his trainers, and well muffled up, be starts out on a walk of from thirteen to sixteen \n            miles-and as a walkist he is a decided success. A day or so ago, when the Natural Bridge road, and, indeed, \n            all the roads about the suburbs of the city were in a muddy, slippery condition, he walked fourteen miles \n            in one hour and fifty-five minutes, loaded down as he was with the heaviest of clothing, and said he felt so \n            little fatigued that he could have repeated it in the same time. His powers of endurance are astonishing. \n            On his return from the walk he enjoys a short rest, then eats supper, and a short time after supper comes \n            another walk of two or three miles. He never ventures out after the dampness of evening sets in, and is in \n            bed promptly at 8 o\'clock. These are his every-day exercises, rain or shine.\n            \n            ### MEMORANDA. \n            \n            For a short time after he went out to the Fairfield House the training was pretty severe for him. It was \n            hard to get used to the systematized work of reducing weight, and at the same time develop the muscles; \n            besides, it was a difficult matter to wean himself from the inactivity of a city life; but he soon "came \n            down to the work," so to speak, and when we saw him be was the personification of health and strength. \n            McCoole of the city, and MeCoole of the ring, are two different individuals. He speaks confidently of \n            "getting away" with Allen, but alluded to his antagonist in complimentary terms. There is, however, in \n            the coming mill, on the part of both these pugilists, an earnest determination to come out victorious. \n            Pride and ambition are doing more toward making it one of the hottest contested fights ever known on the \n            continent than the amount of money now up; and with no intervening sickness - nothing as a drawback on \n            McCoole, he will mak lively work for Allen. As we parted with the fistic giant he was about starting on a \n            fifteen mile walk, and kindly invited us to accompany him-we declined. Couldn\'t make the time in two hours \n            as he proposed doing. Our pedal extremities [were not intended for such time. We are not training for the \n            P.R. The last we saw of McCoole he was swinging off at a lively pace towards the Natural Bridge. he \n            remains but about three weeks more at his pre- ent quarters, his friends are improving the tire in \n            occasional calls. Our visit was a pleasant one, but was paid only to satisfy the taste of mary of our \n            readers who are anxious to know exactly how McCoole looks and how he progresses in getting ready fer the \n            fight.\n',

Alien Laving beem twice cheated in St.\nLouis was not willing that any such game shoul! be\nplayed upon kim in this match.\n\nOn ike viker hand, Jack Looney, who represents\nthe backers of the big giant, asserts that McCoole is\nneither afraid to meet Allen, nor are his backers\nafraid of losing their money: but that Allen's\nfriends have ou a former occasion, after lising their\nstake money, sued for its recovery, and that\nthey are trying to avoid such trouble in the present\ncase, He asserts that the stake-holler must bea\nresponsible St. Louis party, and be is not particular\nwhether he is an adierent of Mcleale or not.\ngai Carroll, who also represents the Allen wing\n\nLeen here all week trying $0 arrange matters,\nbnt bas been unable to do any thing. Last Big\nMr. Thorweger, of St. Louis, aris ie upon\nsame errand. fie has eleven hundred dollars inter-\nest in the stake a'ivanced by Allen, and it is under-\nstood that if he will agree to withdraw his interest\nboth parties will agree upon Lim as stakeholder.\nThere 18 £very reason to beiieve that the complica-\ntien will be satisfactorily adjusted in this way, and\nthere wili be no hindrance of the fight,\n\nBut even if the matter of the stakes is not ad-\nJusted, there is no reason why the 5 a should not\ncome off. Allon says that he is ready and willing\nto fight for the excursion money, or for nothing tn\nfact, in order that be may setile the Hatha of sn-\npericri'y between himselt and MecCoole. The latter\nsays that he will fight for one cent rather than that\nthe match shall Bo deciared “off,” and so the\n“sport” is certain to go on at all events.\n\n1'}e trouble is no: with the peinapely but the men\nwho have a moneyed inserest in this atfair. When\nthere is big money to be fHught for the interested\n\nrties raiurally seek to take advantages. The\nFen: was located here for the purpose of guarantes-\nfrg the men fair play, but it’ these “stake sharpers”\npropose to carry on things in this kind of style, it\nwill but add another wg upon the ring, and, to-\ngether with the disgrac scenes which have oc-\ncurred within aed year, will exercise a good\neffect in the way of breaking up and eradicating tho\nbarbarous evil from the land.\n\neee",

About\neight o'clock she came steaming up the river from\nthe foot of Plum street, and was greeted with anui-\nmation by a crowd of sume fity or more who\nthought the pugilists and friends were safely stored\naway on board.\n\nNine o’clock had been designated as the hour of\nstarting, and the crowd gradually increased to wit-\nness the embarkation of the *“‘vleasure excursion-\nists”, so called, until as the hour arrived there was\na promiscuous mass of people gathered along the\nlevee, watching the party as they came straggling\nalong in twos, fives and tens, ready to go dewn the\nriver, up the river, anywhere to see John Lafferty\n“puxish” George Seddons or vice versa. There was\na vast amount of surmising and speculation in the\ntn re re over the\nDATTOW GANE-way to steamer, carefully guarded\nby two persons whose duty consisted simply in\ntaking the three doliar fee for the pleasure excur-\nsion, or its equivalent in the matter ot pink colored\ntickets. The crowd was of all grades and nationali-\ntics gathered together in that spirit of morbid curios-\nity which always attaches to events of tais character,\nFrom fifty Lo one hundred of these curiosity seekers\nthe number gradually swelled to aboat ome thou-\nsand as the signal whistle and the tolling of the bell\nindicated the readiness of the Lady Pike to start.\nDown close to the water's edge gathered the crowds.\nIn tront were the udvance guard of ret ri\nIhife—the earnest newsboys and boot blacks. Behind\nthem there were all sorts of people, for it was an ex-\ncursion of prize fighters and their friends who love\nsuch things. Many there were whe — went to\ntell those who stzid at home how the Tr Was con-\nducted—how they fought, bled and fall. Of course\nmeg the So rm rr oe\nthey did not ve in g suc! ul\naftairs—dignity revolted at it, and besides it cost\nthem three dollars to patronize it.\n\nSTAET OF THE FISTIC EXCURSION.\n\nWhen toe bell tolled its parting there were about\ntwo hundred on board, noticeable among them were\nthe parties in chief, Lafferty, Seadons, Carty and\nGallagher. Then there was as wer gy Tom\nAllen, Mike McCoole, Dick Roche, 1y Carroll,\nFrank Currie, Al Smth, of Chicago, ach Looney,\nPatsey Curtin, and Pat. afford, Tom vary, Mike\nBeck!in, Tom Garland, and a host otha: “Dead\nbeating” was engaged m as a pleasaut pastime\nax the Boab started In the matter of a free passage.\nFrightful leaps were made with a resemblance of\nfare money in hand. A mumber were put ashore\ntor want of the requisite stamps, and a guard of\n“protectionists” were formed along-the larbord side\nto warn off, beat off and if necessity required, kick\noff all those whose “inalienable rights in\nthe pursuit of Lappiness” did not extend so far as\nP— on board without the requisite stamps.\n\none case an over anxious protection'st drew his\ner ie forced ashore Sa—_— somo pon\n\nto the party on re indignant thus\nabusing one of their party, and rocks, bricks, sticks,\nand indeed anything available came hurling from\nshoreward. At first itseemed like the fire of an\nadvance guard, andthe retreat from shore as the\nLady Pike swung out into the stream met with a\ncorresponding retreat from the lower docks. As\nthe boat swung out about half her length from the\nLevee the hurling of rocks trom shore increased,\ntorcing al! who could into the best protection avail-\nable. Thick and faster they came upon the decks,\nat the cabin and hailing down upon the hurricane\ndeck. Distance lends an enchantment, semtimes,\nte the view—so the pleasant excursionists thought\nin this case as they started.

In a stateroom abeut midships was\nJohn Lafferty, under the kind care of his\ntrainer, Tom Kelly. He was undergoing\nhis last preparation for the combat. It\nwas simple — merely ——— rubbing\nthe hands with a Jeoagation ca ted to harden\nand ne them. He appeared cheerful and con-\nfdent. In the cabin were two banking institutions\n- er S—- i em bank er SON uh\ne other a mn losing mone:\nknown as “lottery,” il by the Fakir cd\nAva, or atleast one of them. Around these were\ngathered a motly crew. These, with the bar, were\nthe only sources of interest to the “pleasure excar-\nsionists.” Gathered along the guards and on the\nbow were groups discussing the coming contest, and\nalso the prospects of chances in the Mace-Allen\nfight. There was much of pugilistic history and\nreminiscences to be gathered among that crowd.\nThey knew it all. Their conversation was enlight-\n— Down past the city the Lady Pike paddied,\nwith ber select and pleasant party. There was little\nbetting on the trip, and there appeared to be but\nlittie woney to offer m all the crowd. A watch was\na curiosity; each seemed to have formed an idea,\nthat the excursionists were mot all honest\nmen, and accordingly left their borer re at home.\nA lasding was made at Carondelet ferry landing at\n10:11, and there came on board Cy Sa\n- with O'Keefe, of Boston, and Henry 3\nSeddons was taken charge of by bis friend Tom\nAllen and hurried into a comforiable birth in the\nreas of the beat for finishing touches.\n| THE PLEASURE GROUNDS.\n\nAta quarier to 12 o'clock the party reached the\nbead of Carrol Island about tweive miles south of\nthis city, a spot of sand and willow g.owth, said. to\ncontain about three hundred and forty acres of\nland (!). It is about one mile long, and varying in\nwidth trom one rod to a ha'f a mile. This islana is\nunder the protection and jaws of Illinois, aud if\nthat State is not proud of it, it is not the fault of the\npeoplo. About midway on this apology for\nmnd is the remmant of a  aistillery\nwhere Uncle Samue! is alleged to have been\ndefrauded out of his dues in the matter of revenue\nin days gone by. The Lady Pike landed near by\nthis piace. About four hundred feet back from the\nsteep and muddy bank was a tittle dilapidated and\n\n~ dooriess log cabin, and the outbuildmgs were in a\n~ Bad state of decay. This was called the “old distil-\nlery.” Infront of it was what might once have\nmade some pretension to a corn-field, somewhat\nmemorable as the spot of ground whers our friend\nAllen was knocked out of time in a little “mil,”\nwith Charley Satine last summer. Fornent the\nold roekery the y Pike landed, and an exploring\nparty, consisting of Roche, Kelly, and a friend or\nsa, “went out to view the land,” and select = site\nfor the “set to.”\nTHE GROUND FOR THE RING.\n\nAt 12:10 the exploring party found the only good\ncamping place for present purposes about pistol-shot\ndistance from the boat, un stream, ona portion of a\nsand-bar, and about :wo hundred fest back from the\nriver, and ten feet above its present level. On the\nopposite side of the river, and above, was .plainiy\nin view the U. S. barracks. Arouud it was one\ndense thicket of young willows and brush. Close\nupon the east, and on the main island, were a num-\nber of tal! trees, hg, roma by the way, offered a\nresting place wr a half dozen or so tree lookers-on\nat the wit Seen and fight. Guards were sta-\ntioned on the boat so as not to allow the “pleasure\nparty” off until the ring was formed.\n\nFrank Carey was master of the ring ceremonies,\nand bis outfit was imanediately brought on shore\nand the work of forming the “aquared circle” com-\nmenced. [t will be borne in mind that certain es-\ntablished and recognized rules govern not only the\ncorduet of “bruisers” In the ring, bat in the for-\nmation of the ring itself.\n\nIt must be twenty-four feet square.

Seadons was seconded - Tom Allen and\nPatsey Curtin. Al Smith, of Ci , was selected\nas referee. While they are being prepared for the\nencounter it affords usan ovportunity to state that\nSeddons is an Englishman, 22 years of age, 5 feet\n23, inches high, well made, weighing 117 pounds.\nLaflerty is an Irishman, 33 years old, 5 feet 7 inches\nhigh, weighs TI Re and lighter build than\nSeddons.

Seddons crossed\nover toward Lafferty’s corner, meeting him and\nshook hands. For a moment they seemed to meas\nure each other.

Seddons' blows went home at times with a\ndeadened Shant wiich was terrific. Lafferty seem-\ned easy and self-possessed, but there was that lack\nof vim and earnestness in all his work which charac-\nterized rene Many of Lafferty’s blows would have\nhad an ugly etlect had they not been given with open\nband. He seemed also to lack that amount of en-\ndurance which wasa marked trait in Seddoas;%and\nyet there was not the slightest disposition on his\npart to cower during the fierce struggle. He\nml pig har and was badly Fre\nw ve br oy gre dog I eye was\nnearly closed a large ugly swelling appeared\nabove it, the left side of his face was\nalso badly swollen, and blood flowed freely\nfrom half a dozen ugly scalp and tace wounds. The\nlast blow in the nineteenth round, heavily given,\nwas what closed the fearful struggle. On the list\ntwo rounds Seddons appeared to be anxious to close\nthe fight with a coup d'etat skilfully executed.\nHe accomplished it on the last blow.\n\nAs soon as the signal of defeat came from Laffer-\nty’s corner and the fight was formally cles>d, Sed-\ndons, with few perceptible bruises upon his face or\nperson, went over to Lafferty’s corner and they\nagain shook hands; then going back to his corner\npicked up a hat, and going round the ring, collect-\noa seventeen dollars from the bystanders and gave\nit to Lafferty.

M. and two o'clock P. M.,\nsomewkere within fifty miles of St. Louis. The\nsteamboat Belle Ida Lad been chartered for the oc-\ncasion, and the legal difficulty relative to her depar-\nture had been smoothed away by Mr. Middleton giv-\ning bord in the sum of $1,000 to protect the\nother owners agaivst possible loss or damage,\nso by 10 v’clock yesterday morning everything was in\nreadiness. For a few days before the day fixed for\nthe fight, it did not seem that the event wonld at-\ntract much attention. But on Monday interest in\nregard to the matter sprung up quite actively, and\nwhile there was but Ifttie betting, the numuver\nanxious to see the mill was quite large. It is so sel-\ndom that the police authorizes of this or any other\ncity have succersfuliy interfered te prevent a prize-\nfight, that any interruption trom this quarter was\nwholly unthought of, and there was no secresy ob-\nrerved us 1o the time and place for the pleasure ex- |\ncursion to start.\n\nFEEPARATIONS FOR THE START.\n\nA.an early nour, and long bL 7 re ie managers\nof the excursion Lad arrived, au esge: ani anxiols\ncrowd had a-sembled om tue leves at the iss of\nAlmond street, sowe to (ake passage and some to\nwiiness the departure of the boat with 1s cango of\nwixed human freight. At quarter before nine, the\ncurtain “1iz’\"—Messrs. Kelly, Thurston Smith, and\nAaron, #tationed themselves at the gang-plank, to\ndemand $3 frem all who wisiel to venture on board.\n\nAs is generally the result on such occasions, the\nmatter of guarding the gang plank was accompan-\nied by surcry exciurg skiimi-hes and one or more\nkncck Gowns. Several im pe unious indiviluals, who\nativmwpted to force their way on board, were decected\nby the vigilance committee and forced to baat a hasty\nTedic at nud were summarily Kicked off.\n\nOre fellow more bend than his predecessors jumped\non heard, aud seemed determined to aves gratuizous\npassage. He was remonstrated with, coaxed, and\nith «a ered, but all 10 ne purpose. lle was timally\nco ir ntel by the indomitable Tom Kelly, who pick-\ned lim up as it he were a chiid, and consigned Lim\n1 th. elcments of the Mississippi. A caulking flat\nbeing pear at band, the unlucky man swam to it\nan clam bering in, succeeded in delivering himself\nfiom a watery grave.\n\nTUM ALLEN ARRIVES.\n\nbg doa at this tue was passing on merrily.\nwhen the din of voices on board was drowned by a\ntum ultinens cheer fiom the crowd on shore, and in\na woment Tom Allen was seen raarching thronga an\nsomiring crowd accompanied by Lis trainer, Jack\nMaddens, toward the steamer. He was met at the\ngang plank by Lis friends and consigned to a state\n100m prepared especially for Lis benetit.  Afler the\npreimivaries bad been arranged, aud Tom bad been\nairceted to recline in the berth, sundry privileged\n\nwar: jes on the boat ventured in to have a chat with\n\nah *ere the departure of te boat. Thomas stated\nthat be was never better in his hfe, weighed 180\n\npounds when stripped, and was confident of success,\nFhe conve: sation was however, prematurely brought\nto & term nation by Madden (Allens trainer) rushing\nin and informing tie party that a squad of police\nwere ou board.\n\nSUDDEN ARRIVAL OF THE POLICE.\n\nIn breath'ess silence the group in the state room\nlis\" ened for a knock at the state room door, speculat-\ning mentuliy it Tom was really about to be arrested,\npee day's anticipated sport prematurely termi-\n1a\n\nne not herds. The knock came and\nCapt. Burgess appeared at door. Bat few words\nwere exchanged. The captain after a few words of\nordinary greeting said: ** The chief wants to see you,\nTom, at tue Central station.” Allen got up prompuly\nand went with the officer. The crowd on the boat\nwere evidently disgusted and vented their feelings in\nmulterings and curses, and only for the presence of a\nrespectable squad of police it is quite probable a res-\ncue of the prisoner would have been attempted. The\ngang plank at one time had been cast off as if to pre-\nvent the retreat of the officers of the law, but it was\neasily restored to its position and no other demon-\nstration was made. Allen was — te the Cen-\ntral police station and was soon wi the shades of\nthe calabocse.\n\nAfter the opt of Allen, the before happy\ncrowd on board began to grow angry, and many an\nugly oath was launched against the police and their\ninterference Then again the question arose, would\nthe t ght come off at all, would Allen return? and\nlastly but not leastly, each man suddesly became\nsolicitous tor the £3 he had paid to come on board.\n\nTHE CASHIER IN THE WATER.\n\nAt this juncture it was reported that the police\nwere again coming te arrest all interested in the\nanangements for the fight. This created a panic and\na geveral scatieration. Barney Aaron, who acted as\ncazhier, was seen gliding around om the outside\nguards of the boats, first Sodging ein then an-\nother, to avoid the observation the cers. The\nsa was soon solved to all outsiders: Barney has\nt men collected fur fares, and for this the police\nare after Lim. He came very near being arrested,\nbut eluded the officer and leaped into theriver. He\nwas immediately picked up by some men in a\nskiff, and the last seen of Barney he was being\nswiftly pulled toward the Illinois shore.\n\nEXCITEMENT ON CHESNUT STREET.\n\nAfter this event the crowd gradually] dispersed\nfrom the boat, and the most of them congregated on\nClestnut street, in the vicinity of the police office.\nHere tbe presence of 9 many men attracted public\nattention, and by 11 o'clock there was as great a |\ncrowd and as muck apparent excitement, as if some |\ngreat local event of importance bad transpired. It\nis somewhat extraorainary why the announcement\nthat ** Allen has been arrested by the police” should\nhave created such a stir, but not more so, perhaps,\nthan the tact that two-thirds of the people who ap-\npearcd interested in the matter manifested more\ntn by with the sturdy prize fighter inki cali than\nthe police anthmities :t 1viog 10 prevent the prize-\ntiyh'. The breaking up of theanticipated nghtand\nthe arrest of Alien, at one time yesterday formed one\nof the EE ——— topics of conversation aimost among |\nall classes. The general inquiry was, ** Where is Gal-\nlagler 2” This, st first, the police did not appear to\nknow, but having reason to believe that he was at\nCarondelet, Sergeant Thomas O'Neil went down |\nthere to effect his arrest.\n\nTOM ALLEN AT THE STATION.\n\nAllen was furnisted with convenient quarters in\nthe balls of the prison, where he was surrounded by\nhalf a dozen friends, to whom he talked freely, la-\nwenting the ill-luck which deprived him of winning\nfresh laurels in the ring.\n\nHe appeared in excellent condition, his face and\nhands ee bronzed like one of Whittaker's hams.\nHis havas bad ratber a dirty look, but this appear-\narce was a necessary adjunct, as they had been |\npickicd im a decoction of vinegar and\n1icsin to harden the flesh. To the\nfeel Lis skin had the bardness of iron and the flesh\nwas as sold, as & bystander expressed it, “as old\ncheese.” The portion of his cheeks below the eyes\nwere of the same character, from undergoing the\nsame pickling process. He wore a scotch knit cap,\nheavy woollen coat, with a small bole torn by a nail\non 1he right shoulder. iis pants were of light cassi-\nwere, with & black stripe runningdown the leg. He |\nwore gaiters, but there was no sign of linen abut |\nLis 1¢ck, which is as burly and well tanned as the |\nface #nd bands. His whele appearance was that of\nan able-bodied wood- chopper, ready to do a good\nday's work. Un ie for the ring, his appear-\nsnee would doubtless have undergone a great trans-\nformation, and ivstead of the owrricr, he would stand\ntorih the splendid athlete that he really is.\n\nALLEN EXPRESSES HIS VIEWS.\n\nAllen, in his rambling remarks, said to Patsy Car-\nten, his second, whe was present, “Why didn't these\nnen come and tell me their man (Gallagher) was\nsick ? Hud they told me, it would have saved all this\ntrouble. pa wife told my wife that\nLe had been three Gays.”\n\nPatsy answered that be (Patsy) saw Gallagher in\nthe merring, and he was shaking and all mutfied up\nabout the neck. He said to G.: “Aint you exposing\nyourself?” —meaning that he might be nabbed .\nthe police. He said be was going anyway, it was\nright, and be expected soon to be wt of their way.\n\nThe chief of police now came in and said to Alien:\n\nWell, Gallaguer will be bere in a few minutes. 1\npropose that you and him shall go through the mo- |\ntions bere. They caught him below Carondolet. He\ncouldn’ get through to save hislife,as I stationed police\null alcpg. Gallagher tried hard to make the ground.\n\na ae\nexploits of celebrated pugilists whom knew in\nEngland, and on the science of sparring generally.\nHe proposed to open a school for about\nforty for tive dollars a head, and to aban-\ndon the ring.

The\nfirst tling done was to prepare the following petition\nfor a writ of Seu.

Before\nhe finished Mr. Voullaire complained that half an\nhour had Sa and still no return had been made.\nHe demanded the return or the release of Allow; said\nthat he wanted no trifling, that all should stand on\nan equal footingy and it made no difference whether\nit be Tom Allen, Abraham Lincoln or Gen. Grant.\n\nMr. Hilton called the attention of the court to the\ncircumstance that the writ did not call on them to\npreduce the body of any particular person, there be\ning a blank instead of a name\n\nMr. Voullsire said Tom Allen's name was in another\npart of the document.

We desire none to be taxed a\nCspt. McDonough.\n\nThe cur: Tle defendant is discharged. The at-\ntachment will also be discharged.\n\nAT LIBERTY.\n\nAllen forced his way through the mixed crowd in\nthe court room, and with Jack Looney and one or\n\nwo other friends stepped into a carriage and drove\n\nrapidly down Chestnut street to the levee and thence\n10 the cot of Spruce sireet where the Belle Ida lay\nwith Ler steam up. The turn out attracted a good\ndeal of attention.\n\nArrived at the boat, Al'en repaired to a state-room,\nwhere Le took lunch. He stared that he c¢ruld not\nclaim the stakes and did not want to, and that the\nfight won'd come off to day. The stakes and ropes\nlay yiled up on the levee, where there was a large\nquantity of liquid refreshments awaiting shipment.\n\nIt was about twenty minutes past one when Allen\narrived at the boa:, and he waited there in expec-\ntarcy of weet g Gallagher, who, he bad been told,\nbad been arrested.\n\nAs the fight bad to take place between 10 and 2,\nthe idea of fighting yesterday was not entertained.\n\nGALLAGER IN DURANCE.\n\nGallsgher, who was arrested at Carondelet in the\nmorning. arrived at the central station about half\npast one Jedock poy. He looks like an overgrown\nyouth, Lis height being six feet two and one-fiurth\ninches. He was very frank and communicative.\nHe wore a mutller aroused bis neck, which orizinated\ni comments about kis being sick, and uatit for the\n\n2.\nHOW HE WAS ARRESTED. |\n\nHe related the manner of his arrest as follows :\nI was atter getting off the train at Carondelet and\nwi= about one hundred rods from the train when I\nwas arrested. 1 was guingto the ferry to take the\nboat. | was arrested by eight er ten policemen.\nPatrick Conver arrested me. They told me they |\nwanted me. 1ssked them for what. They told me\nthey had Allen arrested and they wanted me. 1\nthought there'll be no forfeit of the money when we\nare both arrested. I went along with them.\n\n2 ANXIOUS ABOUT THE STAKES.\n\nThe chief of police now came in and told Galla-\ngher thet be would release Lim in a short time.\nThere wili be no trouble, \"he said, about it.\nGallagher, on learing of Allen's release\nat half past one, began to be uneasy\nfor fear that be would go to the ground and perhaps\nclaim thestakes. He said, consolingly: Well, Allen\ncan’t get there by 2 o'clock, any way; he can’t claim\nany forfeit if be does go there, by ihe rules of the\nLandon ring.\n\nHE DESCRIBES HIS CONDITION.\n\nGallagher coutivued, in reply to questions put to\nbim: I sm iu splendid condition—got no shakes.\n1 weigh 164 pounds. I never feit better in my hfe. I\nhave a noutlier on my neck for fear of catching cold.\nMy height is 6 feet 21; inches. I am 23 years old; born\non the 12th of April, 1:7, in county Kildare, Ireland.\n1 have been in training one mouth; my hands are\nbard flesh.\n\nTHE PLACE FOR THE FIGHT.\n\nWe were geing to Foster's island, 23 miles from\nthe city. At this stage Gallagher inquired if it was\n2 o'clock, and when informed. he appeared quite\neasy about Allen. Hesaid: It's too bad. We had it\nzl] right by this time\n\nPERSONAL PARTICULARS.\n\nIhave been sick for four days since 1 began train-\n\ning, of a kind of fever. It aud me good.\n\nfought twice before on Carroll Island; I am ne\nrelation to Chas. Gallagher; I never saw him, but he\nhas written to me and wonld have been my second;\nmy full name is James Cornelius Gallagher; I left\nIreland three years ago the 24th of last month; I never\nsaw a prize fight before 1 entered the = to fight; I\nbad an ambition for it since I was a child; I studied\nthe science and have got it almost to perfection; Tom\nKelly is my trainer. McCoole and Kelly were to be\nwy seconds; 1'd rather fight than be arrested any time\nI never was arrested betore.\n\nCOXFIDENT.\n\n1corld lick Allen, 1 was sure to it. I never saw\nAllen tight, I eare nothing for his reputation in the\nring atall. Heis mo fighter: I saw Coburn get\naway with him, sparring at Mozart ball; I sparred\nat the same time with the Cast Iron man. Allen\nworries his antagonists by feints; 1 would not follow\nlim about as others have; let him tire himself out.\nThere's where he got them. I don’t drink—never\ndrink when training; I am a stove cutter by trade;\nIdent Lke St. Louis; don’t like the climate as\nwell as Albeny, N. Y., where I have worked; I in-\ntend to go back there as seon as I fight Allen; I have\nlost a great opportunity to-day.\n\nGallagher was finally released about half past\n3 o'clock, no charge having been made against him.\n\nTHE LAW AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE.\n\nThe intention of the chief of police in causing the\narrests of Allen and Gallagher was not so much to\nhave the pugilists punished as to break off’ the fight.\nUnder the existing laws it is a difficult thing to insti-\nlute prosecutions with any success against prize\nfighters. The law passed in 1569 is as follows: It\n\n| provides for the punishment of parties engaged in a\nprize fight, but is inoperative to prevent the arrange-\nments es made and the departure of a prizetight-\ning expedition, which in this city is the best way to\nput an end to such affairs:\n\nAn act for the suppression of prize. Sghting.\n\nn act suppr of ti\n\nSection 1. That every person domi | be engiged\nin o's mn combat with tists, commonly denomi-\npated p fighting, whether such fight or combat be\nfor ope © or oe ee valuable thing, or merely to\ntest the skill or bodily powers of the pugilists or com-\nbatants, ard every person who shall be aiding, as-\nsisting or abe'ting, by a or otherwise, in\nany such fight or combat, shall be guilty of a high\nmisdemeanor. and on conviction thereofshall be pun-\nished by imprisonment at bard labor not exceeding\ntwo years, or by fine net exceeding §1,000, or both.\n\nApproved February 18, 1869.\n\nTle law unser which the arrests were made yes-\nterday reads as follows:\n\nChapter 2t5, section 6, General Statutes:\n\nSECTION 6. If two or more persons shall, in any pab-\nlic place, voluntarily or by agreement, engage in any\nfight, or use any blows or violence toward each other,\nin avy apgry or quarrelsome manner, or do each\nother uy willful mischief, or if any person shall\nassaunit another and strike him, in any public place,\nto the terror or disturbance of others, the person or\nperscns to offending sball be Jeemed guilty of an\nsfiray, and, on conviction, shall be punished by im-\nprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceed-\ning three months, or by fine not exceeding one hun-\ndred dollars, or by both such tine and imprisonment\n\nSFC. 7. If three or more persons shall assemble\ntogether with the intent, or, being assembled, shall\nagree mutually to assist ene another to do any un-\nlawful act, with force or vivlence, against the person\ner property of another, or against the peace, or to\nthe terror of the people, such persons se assembling,\nand each of them. shall be deemed guilty of an un-\nlawtul assembly, and, on conviction thereof, shall be\npunished by imprisonment in the county jail for a\nterm not exceeding six months, or by fine not ex-\nceeding five hundred dollars, or by both such fine ana\nimpri:onment.\n\nAX ATIEMPT TO GET UP OTHER FIGHTS.\n\nAfter the exit of Allen, and the prematere Spee\nture of Barney Aaron, the crowd that remained on\nboard became thirsty for a tight. In order to ailay\nthe excite ment an altempt was made to get . Sav\n\neral minor matches, but all to no purpose. Feehan\nwould not fight Madden, stating as » reason that he\ndid no: Fave the requisite amount of the “necessary ™\nO'Cenror, alias Ked Hand Mike, would not fight\nMortis, owing to the important fact that Morris did\npot make! is appearance. Ked Hand Mike cou d not\nfight Henn berry, as the latter named individual had\ncressed on one of the ferry boats to meet Barney\nAstron on his arrival in Illinois. The\nobject of the ary it is stated, was\nto demand the three dollars which Henneberry\nLad paid to witness the fight. The meeting, it was re-\njoited, terminated satisfactorily to the donator, and\nHer neberry had his money returned. Barney was in\ntown last night, and together with Roach, Looney\nand others, enjoyed themselves after a general fash-\nion.\nNO FIGHT.\n\nTom Allen, and also Tom Kelly, assert that the\nfight will not take place, as there was a clause in the\nagreement that in the case of magisterial interference\nthe stakes would not be forfeited. The money still\nremains in the hands of the stakeholders. Tom Kel-\nIy was accused of causing the arrest of Allen and\nGallagher, but denies all complicity in the ma'ter.\nHe moreover generously states that he hopes every\nman who paid will get his money back. The men of the\nfancy need notquarrel among themselves about the\narrests. No Todirmant caused them. The chief\nmade them on kis own responsibility as an officer of\nthe law, and announces his firm determination to\nbeep on arresting prize-fighters bound for a fight,\nwhenever be gets a chance, and he will generally be\nbmp to their movements as their own\nbackers.",

When a professor of the “‘manl!y\nart” offers to bat anothers professor of M. A. a\n| thousand dollars that he can punch his Irish\n| snpot oftener and hotterer than the other fel-\n| low, that'sa “‘deri.” We dou’t cotton muaeh to\nthe classics on fighting subjects, but itis sup-\n posea to mean a challenge. Well, Tom Allen\nH wants to back himself for £10,000 to fight any\n+ man in the country, which is intended particu-\nf larly to include Joe Coburn of New York, and\n| le has fent on the deri to the New York World.\n| We are not given much to throwing away ad-\ni vice, but we will this one iime\nuse for a flyer, as the Count de Loouey\nwould observe. Our advice to Tom Alien 1s to\n| wive up fighting, and to turn his attention to his\nlegitimate business, which is whiskey, lager\nand cigara, and the sale thereof. The ring is\n| dead in England, and it is nearly dead here. It\njever there was a remote cause for 1ts sustain-\n; ment in the sentiment and belief that it en-\nj conraned manliness, that sentiment is dead. It\n! died in the despicable blackguardism that sur-\n| rounded it. We do not intend to designate all\n| the professors of pugilism as despicable black- |\n| guards, but a great many of them\n| are, and the good men must\n| suffer for the raflianly horde |\nthat cluster round the ropes at every mill. Sev- |\n| eral of the oid professors in St. Louis fully un-\n| derstand this, including Looney aud Tom Kelly, |\nland they clearly understand also that from\n| this time there cannot be a fight decided on 1ts\nmerits except by a mere aceident. Tom Allen |\n| has done enough in the fighting way, aad he\n| had better conclude to *‘cut it.” Whether he so |\n| concludes or not, he will have to doit, for a law |\nwill be passed this winter to make prize-fighting i\nlor match-making in this state an impossibility. |\nTom has licked some very good men amd some |\n| scrubs, which latter class includes DMe- |\n| Coole and that other fraud that ® swindled |\n| him out of his money at Omaha. As for |\n{fighting Joe Coburn, it will come to nothing.\n1i a mate contd be made—for the arsument of\n| the thing—there would be enough of the Water |\nstreet erowd present to prevent anvthing like a |\n! fair fisht. When Coburn and Mace met, didn’ |\n| they stand up for an hour almost without a blow |\nbeing struck? Mace didn’t want to win, even if\n| he coulda have done so, and allowed Coburn’s |\n| friends to win the time money without a show\n| of fight. Why? Beeause, if he hal won, he\n{wouldn't have lived a year. A year? No, not\n| Bix months. The romany knew this, and, hav- |\nling done all be could—beaten all the best men—\n| he wanted to settle down quietly without a big\n| feud on his hands.\n| Tom Ailen, if he is wise, will give upall |\n| thougnts of fighting. This rowdyism in St.\n| Louis born of the prize ring must be stopp ed. |\ni [ts surroundings are brutal and disgusting, and |\n{ demoralizing to our boys and young men, who\nare and should be superior to such vile influ |\nences and such pernicions examples. There |\nmusi be an end of it, and now that annther |\n| challenge is out, emanating from St. Louis, |\nthis is the time to prove that it ean be stopped. |\n| Let Mr. Mudd make his bill strong and push it\nthrough on the ruse, with heavy penalties at- |\ntached to its violation, and there will be an end |\nto this disgraceful excitcinent about prize-\n| fighting. i\n1 ————— I — —— M",

Because I'm Tom Allen\nany fool thinks he has the right to come in\naud shoot off bis mouth at me.”\n\n‘‘Whnat's your opinion about the law against\nprize-fighting\n\n**I think it’s unnecessary and uncalled for in\nthis state.”\n\n“Why 17\n\n“Why ? Because they never fouzht in the\nstate. They always went out of the state, either\ntuto Illinois or Louisiana. I think it a mistake\nso put it down. It's a manly exercise and a\ninterest to the people of the city to keep it up.\nWhy, there's the members of the legislature\nthat passed the bili; don’t they carry a bloody\nbattery around with them? Isn't that worse\nthan fighting with the fist !”\n\nWe suggested to the champion that fighting\nflidn’t seem to equalize matters so well as the\npistol or the knife, although, of course, we\ndidn't advocate either. Between a\nlarge ul and i small man\nequally scienced and with equal courage we\ncould'nt detect the equality between thew.\nSuperior brute strength must decide in favor of\nthe large man.\n\n**ln England,” continued Allen, ‘tle, don’t\nfight with the knife, and thousands tight with\ntheir tists every day. You don’t hear of\nders there as you do here. Why § Because boys\nare brought up to put up their hanas and defend |\nshemselves, and they don't murder one another\nbecause they quarrel.” |\n\n“sSociety is differently constituted here,\nTow, and men don’t end a fight with a knock-\ndown.”\n\n“*Yes, and look at the fellows that do draw\npistols. Why, I've sc¢en ‘em turn as pale as\nghosts when they do it. Do you call that pluck ?\nBrave men don’t turn pale when they're going\ninto a tight.”\n\n“Let us ask you what you think of pugilismn as\nit exists now in this country t”\n\n*‘As it stunds now it’s quite time it was done\naway with. There's nothing in the manly art\nas itis now. No honest man has « chance; not\nanless he's associated with gamblers and pimps,\nand thieves. Then he's hunkydory and can car-\nry the crowd with him. The bigger the loafer\nthe better man he 1s with them.”\n\n“‘The opinion of men who ave friendly to a fair\nght on its merits, Allen, is that you can not be\npermitted to run a fight here. The McCoole\nfight stands for nothing. He was a big fraud as\na fightist. ”\n\n‘The man’s in trouble, I've got nothing to\nsay against him. As to this law, can’t men\nBght in Canada or in York state t The law\ndon’t prevent that. One law can’t make laws\nfor another state can they !\n\n‘Clearly not. But the law may read, and\ncertainly does, that no watch can be made\nbere to fight elsewhere.”\n\n*‘What does that watter? The match can be\nbe made in Canuda or New York or somewhere-\nslse iu the East. In this bill I'm made to sual-\nter for others. Why, they put my name init to\nwurk me, and the Times had an editorial about\nme that I was » refugee.”\n\n“‘What did they mean\n\n“I don’t know. I'm no refugee; I can go\nback whenever [ want to go. I'm a prize-\nbghter, and they can’t say any more agin me\nthan that. No man can ever say I’ve done wrong\nsgainst him, I came here to live, and I'm\nKolog to stay here. When men come here from\nall parts to ses me—some miners came here\nto-day, two hundred miles out of their way, to\nsee the tunnel and me. One of em made a\nspeech about me, Ho said he'd heard tell of\nCow Allen, and he wanted to see him.”\n\n“Quite complimentary. And, now, don't\nyou think you've got a better thiug here, at-\ntending to your business, than wearing your-\nself out by training and then to get robbed out\nthe stakes 1°\n\n*‘I side with the legislature about this bill\nagainst prize-tigntine. If it’s got so that there\ncan't be a rair tight, why, stop it. A man who\nwants a fair tight on its merits hasn’t got no\nchauce. It's not the fighting men that's to blame\naud that break up the contidence. Its the gang\nthat follow the ring.”\n\n“‘“That [ believe to be true. The fight with\nMcCoole proved it.

They don’t mean to bar sparring,\ndo they\n\n“‘I believe it is Included in the prohibition of\npublic exhibitions.”\n\n‘Well, but it’s a play—the Tom and Jerry\nseene—and I don’t see why Deagle can’t engage\n$wo sparrers just as well as he can two trapeze\nmen and clog and dance men\n\n**There’s some logic in that.”\n\n‘Arthur Chambers and Billy Edwards are\ncoming on here about the 7th of March and they\nwant to give some exhibitions; in fact, Deagle\nhus got thew, or will have them for a week, ana\nIdon't believe Mudd’s bill ean prevent it. At\nall events, we mean to test it.”\n\n“*Billy Edwards has never been here\n\n“‘No; he's the little man that fought Sam Coll-\nyer aud Barney Aaron. As for Chambers—\nyou remember him seconding me—he's a Man-\nshester man, and the best I ever saw of bis size.\nHe stands over \"em all!”\n\n**GGood nignt, Tom, 1'll call in again.”\n\n*‘Do, sir; glad to see the REPUBLICAN always.\nYou've always been fair and honest with me,\nsnd that's ail as J want from anybody.”\n\nTom Allen looks well, but 18 much fatted and\ngrosser, of course, than when in a state of pre-\nparation for his recent fights, There\nis also—as seen vesterday—a marked\nimprovement in his manner. There is a larger\nand pleasing absence of sauguinary and profane\nadjectives than ue was wont to interlard his\nvery Englisn style of conversation with a few\nmouths ago. Tom is a perfect specimen of the\nblunt, rough, hard-toiling, middle county\nEnglishman, and don’t pick his words either for\nfriend or foe, and would just as soon tight as\neat, and a little sooner at a pinch. He reminds\nus strongly of one of poor Leach’s admirable\nPunch sketches of life in the black country (coal\ncountics) of England. A rough ‘‘navvy’ is\nleaning against a post, and a girl—his wife—has |\nJust come up.

The readers of the Times will remems- |\n| ber that Mace and Allen fought a brutal!\ncontest in New Orleans, in Mav, 1570. In|\n| that contest Allen was defeated. Since then |\nAllen has improved, as his last contest, on |\nChoutean island, Ills., last fall, ney 1 |\nwas at this contest that Allen becged of |\n| MeCoole's seconds not to let him come up|\nagain, and a number of the more tender-:\nhearted roughs, who surrounded the ring, |\nshouted to McCoole’s friends: *“Take him;\naway.” The sporting men of this city think\nAllen is no match for Mace. The latter will\nbe backed from this erty, while Allen will i\nbe backed from St. Louis.

Rooke. |\ni a\nFor $5,000 and the Championship.\ner\n\nTom Allen is matehed to fight George Rooke\nof New York, for $2,500 a side and the eham-\npionship, early in the spring. On last Bunday\nweek Arthur Chambers, champion of the light-\n| Weights, put up $250 for a binder for Allen in |\nthe hands of Harry Mill, and the backers of |\neach Were to meet last night to sign articles of\nagreement to fight within five hundred miles of\nNow York, at catch weights, and sceording to\nthe rules of the Loudon prize ring. |\nWe thought thas Allen had wisely\nconnie to give ap slogging for\na profession and attend to his business as & |\n| saloon keeper, as an infinitely more respestable |\n| way of gaining a living, but the old desire to |\n| appear once mors within the twenty-four foo: |\n' roped ring has come over him, and iu he goes |\nwith one of the greatest gluttons as a pugilist |\nthat is to be found perhaps in all the world.\nWe cannot call to wind the men with whom\nRooke has fought, but enough is known of\n| him to say, that he 18 a thorougly game man,\n2 hard hitter, & good wrestler, aad if he does\n| not possess as much science as Allen has a\n| physical system that can receive as mich, and\nperhaps more punishment than his prospective\n 8dyersary. He ia a Bewery and Houston\nrough of the roughest kind, and either belongs\nto Joe Coburn’s crowd or the erowd thatis\nzr Joe., and thoss two crowds comprise\nall there is of New York roughery. He has\nfought several times with the beat second-class\nmen snd nearly always came off A 1;\nthe last tight in which he was |\nmatched, hav ing been scratched by reason of a |\nbar-roem fight, iu which somebody was nearly |\nor quite killed, we forget which. Under any |\neircumstances Rooke is no gift te Allen or any |!\nother man now in the ring, and if it ever comes |\nto a mill, which we doubt, Allen, evea if |\nshould win, will not be sorry when Barney |\nAaron throws up the sponge for Is\n| pal. The fact of all this  fe— |\nassuming thas fight is meant on\nboth sides—that thers is a determivation\namong the New Yorkers to lick Tom Allen if |\nthey ean. A quiet fend has existed for some |\ntime between Joe Coburn and Allen, and the |\nlatter would sooner fight Coburn than any man\nliving, bar none. Coburz bas got all the will\nto respond, but there's nothing left of him in-\nside, and he and all the New York spor iing men\nknow it. If Joa were as good as when he\ncrossed the - Atlantie to fight Jem\nMace, he ecounla meet Allen and\nthere wouldn't be a cent’s choice between them.\nBut Coburn isn’t that kind of a man now, and\nfeeling irritated at the constant echallengea—\nofficially and otherwise—siung from West to\nEast at him, ne and his crowd have put up\nRooke against Allen, knowing that Rooke can\nstand iong enbugn against the Western man to\nwin bets on time and, perhaps have 2 chance of\nbripging off the stamps.\n\nLet us look at Allsn. He has done nothing in\nthis counmtry but beat a lot of good novices\nlike the Gallazhers, and that siouchiest of all\nchopping bloeks, Mike Mc¢Coole. Jem Mace\nhandled him with ease in New Orleans, although\nhe did tell Arthur Chambers that he gave\nMace hia head because he found the old man\n‘was getting slow. But Mace is an exceptional\nman, and fightingon the dead square to win.\nNo man in the world in bis day bad a chance\nwith him barring accidents, such, for\ninstance, as befell Alien in that\n| knook down under the jugalar\nwith Gallagher; Allen has always been a good\n‘man. His fights with Joe Goss, the best of the\n‘second-elass men in England. were rough af-\nfairs, and Rooke comes nearer to Goss than any\nman we can think of. Rooke has got more\nrough dash than oid Joe had, but they are of |\nthe same stamp. Sinee Allen fought Goss,\nsome years have passed, and Allen\nis older; still, on that score, perhaps,.\nwith the exeeption of wrestling skill, the a\nvantage in physigue is in favor of Allen, who |\nhas taken his winck ous of # fast life a little |\nmore serenely. As for the mill, if the men ever\ndo meet in the ring, the chances are that it will\nnever be fought out to a satisfactory result. |\n¥ive hundred miles from New York means in\nthe vicinity of Pittsburg, and what with the |\nHousten sireet crowd and the Hogan crowd who |\n| have no love for Alien, there will be some lovely\nwork before Barney Aarom and Joe Coburn suf-\n| fer thie sponge to be thrown up to seocop down\ntheir ducats.\n{ pe stem",

Few\nwould ruspect that the personage attired in a per.\nfeotly fiiting black coat and vest, lavender panta\nloons and silk bat, neat necktie and immaculate\nliner, was none other than Tom Allen, the fam ws\nknight of the fives. On the little finger of his ier\n‘‘duke,” sparkled a valuable dismond. The broken\nnose and scarred features always coupled with a\npugilisi’s appearance were missing, thus denoting\nthat ecience had kept the face well protected in his\nnumerous bates, Tom is nof only a magnificent\nspecimen of physical manhood, but is handsome,\nlikewice, ;\n\nThe reporter hed called fo inferview him in regard\nto the approaching **mill” with Rooke, and have a\nchat on ring matters generally. Did he object?\n\n“Not in the least.”\n\nThe reply being ceurteous, the conditions of the\nbattle were first discussed, and it was ascertained\nthat the fight comes off on the 17th of June, within\nfifty miles of Plttaburg, and is for $1,500 a side.\n\n*'WHAT GAVE RISE TO THE MATCH?\"\n\n**You see,” sald the champion, **Rooke challenged\nme in the New York papers, and then went around’\ngiving exhibitions and announcing on his bills that\nfie would fight Tom Allen. He algo stated that I\nchallenged.Jce Coburn because I knew he would not\nfight me. His original challerge was for $2500 a side,\nand I gat to hear of it through Arthur Chambers. Al-\nthough I had determined to quit the ring, this\nbluster annoyed me, and I authorized Arthur to\ncover the deposit. They met at Harry Hills, in\nNew York, on the 16th of February, when Rooke\nwanted fo reduce the stakes to $1,000 a side. We\nwouldn’t accommodate him at this, buf finally com.\npromised on $1,600. I blamed Chambers for giving\nRooke his own way in everything else, but Arthur\nssid not to let the bloke out of it,\n\n**W1ll there be any excursion ?”’\n\n$*No, rooke wanted one, but I wouldn't have it\nunless all the money went to the winner.”\n\n“*Who is this Rooke, any how?”\n\n¢'He is ot Irish descent, and, like mjself, was\nborn in Rirmingham.

When twenty-two yoars old\nand weighing only 134 pounds, one Saturday night,\nI was matched to fight Posh Price on Monday morn~\ning, He was twenty-eight years old, and sixteen\npounds heavier.

Igoteven with Price in our second\nbattle for which we both trained. Joe Gossandl\nfought a draw, which was a tough contest. My\nshortest fight was with Gallagher, who put ma t0\naleep in a couple of minutes by a chance blow on the\njugular,”\n\n‘*Who do you consider the most solentific ex-\nponent of the fistic art?”\n\n*'Mace by all odds,”\n\n‘*How did Sayers compare with him?\"\n\n~~ '‘Maco was the oléverest, but\n\n| SAYERS WAS ALL GAME,\n\n- and was also vory clever,”\n\n‘How did Sayers compare with you, as to build?”\n\nDell's Life anid there never were two men put up\n£0 nearly alike as Sayers and Allen, When in con-\ndition, we were exactly of a weight, our bodies being\nthe best part of us.”\n\n** What do you think of MoeCoole?”\n\n**He is a game man, and can stand a fearful lot of\nprniskment.

They should have arranged the fight one\nday later, go we could celebrabe the anniversary of\nthe battle of Waterloo.”\n\nFrom this point the interview drifted info a dis-\ncuseion on ring matters generally, and the champion\nentertained his visitor with some interesting anec-\ndotes of his connection with the fistic fraternity in\nEurope and America. Ie referred to many memor-\nable meets in Merrie England, and rehearsed many\nhistorical scenes of the Indian mutiny that occarred\nwhile he was drawing his shilling a day as a British\nhusgsar. Tom referred to the firat visit of himsif and\nBill Ryall, who, a couple of years ago, threw up the\nsponge to Death, to St. Louis in 1863, when a millon\nBloody Island was an every-day occurrence, and no\ninterference was feared from the municipal authori-\nties, The fatal fight between Fagan and Andy Love\nwas spoken of. During the conversation the reporter\nlearned that there was not a dollar at stake when\nAllen and Mace faced each other in the squared oir-\ncla rear New Orleans, and that Harry Slade, the\namateur sparrer, was more than a match for the\ncleverest professional with the gloves. He learned\nthat Slade is going Into business on his own account\na8 a commission merchant in Chicago, and that the\nchampion was married in Vincennes, Indiana.\n\nThose who are of opinion that the most scientific\nfightist is one who can hit and avoid a returp, are\ngreatly mistaken. Just where to hit and when is\nthe main point, and Allen has man’s anatomy down\nas fine as a surgeon, Hecan tell just what effect\neach blow will have on his opponent, knows just\nwhere to plant his fist to cause most mischief, and\ndon’t object to exposing an invulernable spot when\nhe can follow up his antsgonisv's blow with a cross-\ncounter. Tobe appreciaied the fine points of ring\ntactics must be explained by the champion himself.\n\neee lee.",

On June 1 the final |\nstake-holder waa selected, Mr. Jno. Chamber-\nlain. He accopted. A few days later he was\ninformed that Joe Coburn had organized a\ngang of rufians to go ‘on to Pittsburg\nand win the fight for Rooke if he\n\n| was not able to do so himself. This plan was\nto be carried out strictly to the letter, as fol-\nlows: If the Rooke party could not secure a\nreferee in their favor they determined to win |\nthe fight on an alleged foul. If they were\ni balked in the referee business the gang from\n{ New York were to crowd in Allen’s corner\n| and when Rooke forced the fighting a cry of\nfoul was to be raised in Allen’s corner by\nRooke’s friends. Then the latter were to\nbreak down the ropes in Allen’s corner and |\nitooke’s seconds were to claim the fight\non the ground that Allen’s friends\nbroke into tke ring. The referee would then\n[ be cblized to give his decision in favor of!\nRocke, according to the rules. Backers of |\nRocke would then receive the stakes, and if\nAllen sued he could not recover. Chamber- |\nlain, however, at the eleventh hour, declined\nhaving anything to do with the affair becanse\niwo of nis friends had money mn Rooke’s\n| $1,590, and they understanding they were to i\nbe cheated out of it, claimed the money they i\nhad put in the stakes, and he refused\nto have anything to do with the aflair. |\nNo blame can be attached to Allen. He\nthought he had only to fight and win. Rooke\nwas also anxious to fizht, knowing that if he\ncould not win the Coburn gang would win\nfor him.\n\nPrize-fighting has fallen into decay, not only\namong the once reputable sporting men, but\namong the rougher element who have patron.\nized pugilists. The wretched bruisers who\nhave formed the central figures of the brutal\ngatherings found that getting a shocking drub-\nbing with the usual mutilations put money\nonly into the purses of their backers. A prize\nfight for £3,000 meant that certain well-to-do\nbrutes stood a chance of winning as much\nmore as they could extra from the savage\ncuriosity of the motley crowd by excursion\nmoney. Because there was no possibility of\nan excursion from Pittsburg is one of the prin-\ncipal reasons why Rooke’s backers would not\nagree to Harry Hill of New York for stake-\nholder. The victor in one of the latter-day\nfights found himself a beggar around the fishy\nhaunts of his patrons, while the vanquished,\nwith a face like a piece of claret jelly, thrown\nagainst the wall, was despised and left help-\nless on the scene of the contest. So\nthe pugilists wisely deserted what\nwas miscalled ‘the manly art,’’ to the swind-\nling tactics of their backers. Fights were ar-\nranged, excursions got up at five dollars\neach; no fights took place, except occasional\n“¢‘scrimmages’’ during the trip when some cit\nizen objected to being robbed by gamblers -and\nthieves, who were passed on board free in or-\nder that theymight break up the fight if wanted.\nThe principals in the meantime are purposely\narrested or take the wrong tran, or if they do\nget into the ring, they fail to agree upon a ref-\neree.\n\nTo-day the backers of the men met to\ndecide upon a final stakeholder, when it was\ndiscovered that Shaughnessy, one of Rooke’s\nbackers, had put an attachment on the stakes\nnow held by Harry Hill. Mr. Muldoon, an-\nother of Rooke’s backers, authdrized Billy\nEdwards, Allea’s representative, to notify\nAllen that when Shaughnessy withdrew his\nshare of the money ne would make up the de-\nficit to one thousand, and if Allen would agree |\nto fight Rooke for that amount, within ten\ndays, 50 miles from Pittsburg, he would post\nthat amount with Harry Hill. Rooke is here\nwaiting Allen’s reply. He would have left for\nPittsburg but his backers would not give him\n\n| money to go.\n————",

I was prepared to\nrenew any amount, or to fight him for the\nchampionship without a dollar.

We could not meet on the\nseventeenth under our old articles\nof agreement, and he knew I wanted a new\nmatch. He knew I wonld not be in the ring.\n\nJluowing all this he threw in his cap, showed\nLis own bravery, accused me of cowardice and\nran away.

We believe Allen’s old\nantagoualst in the 24-foot ring, and histrionic\nprecursor, Jem Mace, appeared on Niblo’s\nstage, New York, as Charles, the wrestler,\nin **As You Like It,’’ a Shakspearian role.\nIf Shakspeare could make a part for a wres-\ntier, there is no reason why a modern play-\nwright should pot write a play for a boxer.\n\nWe presume that Allen's venture, if he makes\nit, will be one of muscle rather than brains,\nand there is no reason why he shouldn’t win.\nWuen we hear more about it, we'll tell more,\nand shall await with anxiety the adveut of the\nAmerican hero on the dramatic boards. 1",

FEBRUARY 1\nBR a rea\n\nTHE PRIZE RING.\n\nTalks 3y the Bruilsers of New York\n\nand Elsewhere.\n\nFrom the Chicago Times.]\n\nNew YORK, January 27.—The prize-\nfight between Johnny Dwyer and Steve\nTaylor, of Jersey City, for $590 and the\n\n“championship of the heavy weights, is\nstill the subject of discussion among the\nsporting circles of Brooklyn and this\ncity. It is certain that Taylor, on last\n\nMonday, was no match for Dwyer, and\nthe latter's chances of winning were\nnever in doubt after the second round.\nIt has often beer proved, and is beyond\n\n“doubt, that a man must be well trained\nand in condition, to successfully\nparticipate in any competition, especial-\n\nly a contest like that on Monday. It\nwas the same as a prize-fight, ex-\ncept that the principals had gloves on.\n\nBoth men knew they had to win by hard\nblows and endurance. Taylor was not\nin condition, and he wore shoes without\nspikes aud was unable to keep his feet.\nTaylor, m a recent contest with Prof.\nWin. Miller, broke the small bone of his\nright arm, and the bone had not time to\nknit firmly. Taylor knew this all along,\n\n~~ and stopped his friends from betting that\n\nhe would win. Taylor did go through a\ncourse of what he called training—that\nis, he reduced himself from 214 to 194\npounds, but he did not harden and\nstrengthen his muscles as he should have\ndone. Therefore, with these obstacles to\novercome, he had no chance of standing\nup against the sledge-hammer blows of\n\n. such an experienced pugilist as Dwyer,\nbut with a strict course of training and\nhis arm as strong as it used to be, Taylor\ncould enter the arena against Dwyer,\nand the contest would be an obstinate\nand protracted struggle. Dwyer went\ninto the match with Taylor with a deter-\nmination to do all he could to win. He\nlooked upon Taylor as a determined,\nthorough boxer, and knew he had no\neasy match without he traiced and\nworked hard. He trained into condi-\ntion, and he was, on last Monday night,\ncapable of disputing the right of any-\nbody aspiring for the championship.\n\nHe wore spiked shoes, which gave him a\ngreat advantage over Taylor, as the lat-\nter would slip at every blow he\nwould make. To-day, Joe Coburn,\nin a dispute with Taylor, said:\n“You cannot fight; neither can Johnny\nDwyer. I can whip you, and I can whip\nDwyer. Ncither he nor yeu are any\n«ood, and both of you have a heap to\nlearn if you ever fight in the ring.” Tay-\nlor replied that he was ready to fizht\n\nSv duybody, and he would declare himself\nafter he saw his friends. It is probable\nthe affair will end in a regular match for\n£1,000 a side, being arranged between\nthe rivals, Joe Coburn, Johnny Dwyer\nand Steve Taylor, Brooklyn sporting\nmen are almost frantic over Dwyer's\nperfermnances, and they offer ty match\nrim, now that he has entered the arena,\nto tight any man in the world for $1,000\n\n & side and upward. Joe Coburn can get\nmatched to dlght anybody for any amount\nas soon a= he is ready to fight,\n\nGeorze Rooke is givetly awaiting to\net ona match with some one. while\nTom Allen of St. Louis, who holds the\ntitle of champion of America, isanxious\nly awaiting the arrival of Jem Mace, and\nif that noted bruiser does not soon come\nover, Allen will be looking for a match\nto cain fresh laurels. Jolmny Dwyer\nbeat Tom Allen several years ago in a\ncontest in Central hall, Bowery. Allen\n\nhas not forgotten that event, and it\nwould just suit Allen to arrange a mately\nwith the Brooklyn giant to try and rab\nout that reverse. In the meantime,\nTaylor, notat all satisfied with the result\non. Monday night, states that he is ready |\nto arrange a match azainst any man in |\nAmerica but Tom Allen, to ficht at\ncatch weight, according to the rules of\nthe London prize ring, for 31,000 a side,\nthe tight to take place within 500 miles\nof New York next April. No doubt\neither Jolinny Dwyer, Joe Colburn, or\nGeorze Itooke may accept the challenge,\n\nFrom present indications, there prom-\nises to De a lively time in pugilistic cir-\ncles.\n\nA communication has been received\nby The News from Boston, which reads\n\n* as follows:\n\n+ SHARvVARD STREET, BosTOoN, Jan.\n25.— Having witnessed the glove contest\nbetween John Dwyer and Steve Taylor,\nin your city, on Monday, oblige me by\n\ni publishing the following inthe spotting\ncolumn of The Daily News: 4 will\nwatch I'rof.

Donnelly, whose real name\nis George Bruer, I took from the streets\nsome months since where he was getting\nbut §1 25 aday as a labor«r clothe 1 him and\nput him in training. Alter continuous la-\nbor 1 made a clever boxer of him—provid-\ned him with money wh mever he wante| it,\nlodged and boarded him and treated him as\na gentleman. On Taesday morning he\ncame down stairs from over my late saloon\non Wash’ngton avenue. where he slept, and\ngot money from behind the bar and went to\nbreakfast. R:turning he left a note for me\nsaving,\n\n\"I HAVE PLAYED IRISHMAN LONG ENOUGH.’\n\nI asked him what he meant; he told me\nhe had something better in view. I asked\nhim if he was going to go back on his engage-\nment with me to goto Chicago afterall I had\ndone for him, when he sneered at me amd\nI knocked him down, and he lay where he\ntell and cried like a woman. He got up\nwhen he found I was not going to tap him\nsgain; went off and had my trunks attach-\ned for $125. This was done you see to get\nmy traps. so I could not fulfill my engage-\nment at Chicago. But after some trouble 1\ngot everything fixed all right and will go to\nChicago, fill my engagement, and return\nhere on the 25th.\n\nHow about goine to England *\n\nWell, that is a bloody lie, for I had no\nmore intention than yeu have of gomnz to\nthe old country. Do you think I would go\nirom St. Louis, where I have lived seven\nvears? No; I intend to live in St. Louis.\nThat story was gotten up by Brurer alias\nDonnelly and Billy Allen, of the St.\nLouis Adelphi. You see Allen wanted\nme to go to his theater and spar with Joe\nCoburn, but I wouldn’t spar with\n\nTHAT DIRTY BLACKGUARD,\n\nfor when I was in New York he refused to\nspar with me, and I couldn't get a New\nYorker to “put up” before me. When Billy\nAllen found I wouldn’t have anything to do\nwith Coburn. he got around Burer alias\nDonnelly, and prevailed upon him to break\nwith me. You see that’s what caused ihe\ntrouble, and Billy Allen has been keeping it\nup as an advertisement for his place.\n\nBut Tom, a correspondent in the Globe-\nDemocrat, this morning intimates that you\nare skipping out to aveid meeting Coburn.\nHow's that?\n\nWhy should I skip out to avoid Coburn?\nJoe Coburn has no more intention of fizht-\ning me than I have of jumping off the Court\nHouse. I have given Coburn every chance\na man could give but he won’t fight me, and\n[ authorize the DISPATCH to state that while\n[ am gone to nr I have made ar-\nrangements with Fred Watkins, my backer,\nof 720 Main street, to accept any challenge\nCoburn or his friends may offer for $500 a\nside or more, and if they mean business.\nthe money will be up in two hours. I\nwouldn’t want any better sport than to get\nJoe. Coburn out of the bounds of the law in\nthe Indian Territory, ter instance, where a\n+ a fight a week without being mo-\n\nested.\n\nThere is a statement to the effect that the\nconstable closed you up?\n\nWell that too,\n\nIS A BLOODY LIE.\n\nThe lease on the place I had expired and as\nthey are going to tear down the old house,\nand re-build of course I had to get out, but\nI am a for another place. My goods\nwere not sold as stated, but are stored at\n1222 Collins street. This scoundrel Brurer\nand my enemies got up these stories out of\n~pite against me. They won't fight me and\ntake this means of doing me hurt.\n\nTom's bartender, James Garvin, corrobo=\nrated this statement, and said he never\nhesrd the champion say he was going to\nEngland. Tocm expressed his thanks to the\nreporter, and said any messages sent to the\nDI: PATCH would be recognized by him.",

Both men were in good condi-\ntion, Bauer weighing 176 pounds, and\nSchroeder 243; the former confident and the\nlatter hopeful.\n\nAt half- past eight o’clock Tom Allen made\nhis appearance on the stage, accompanied by\nArthur Chambers and Billy Edwards, the\nlight-weight champions, whom he introduced\nto the audience. They arrived in the city\nvesterday morning, and are billed for a ben-\nefit at the Adelphi theatre on Thursday even-\ning next.\n\nThe pugilists then retired and the wrestlers\ncame forward, Bauer first and Schroeder\nnext. accompanied by their umpires, Mr.\nFrank Printz for Schroeder and\nBilly Edwards for Bauer. They were\ngreeted with cheers. Tom Allen then stated\nthat he had been chosen referee, and would\nfill the position to the best of his ability. He\nthen called ‘*Time,’” and the men advanced\n\n{ towards each other and began the struggle.\n\nThe first bout, by agreement, was accord-\ning to the German style. which permits of no\nback holds and no neck locks. This bout\nlasted 14 minutes and was won by Bauer,\nwho showed throughout his thorough mastery\nof his profession, taking matters as coolly\nand as easily as his burly antagonist would\nlet him, and vet being always on the alert\nwhenever he saw an advantage to be\ngained. Schroeder, after a few minutes work,\nbegan to puff and blow, and the perspiration\nrolled from his face. He found that he had\nbefore him no plaything, and that, with all\nhis giant strength, he had to exert himself to\nthe utmost if he hoped to wih. After\nseveral ineffectual efforts he managed\nto get his right arm round Bauer's\nwaist, and then his left, when both\nmen struggled fiercely for a few mo-\nments -towards the right wings. Bauer\nbroke the grip, but was soon afterwards\nseized in the same manner and forced to his\nknees, when Schroeder secured the best hold\nof the bout, grasping Bauer around\nthe waist sideways and lifting\nhim off the stage; but in doing so, the latter,\nwith a good deal of strategy and no less ac-\ntivity. broke loose from him, amid the ap-\nplause of the audience. Bauer then got a\nwaist grip on Schroeder, raised him from the\nground, and fcllowed up his advantage by\nthrowing him on his knees. It looked to the\naudience as if he ought to have still wrestled\nwith him, but the rules of the German style\nrequire that when one man is on his knees the\nother shall allow him to arise. This Bauer\ndid. He then allowed Schroeder to get\na good shoulder grip, rested a\nfew seconds, and then, exerting\nall his strength, turned Schroeder over his\nshoulder to the ground, where he threw his\nweight on him and forced both of his shoul-\nders to touch the carpet. There was consid-\nerable cheering at this display.\n\nA fifteen minutes’ recess was then taken to\nallow the men to cool off. Bauer stated toa\nREPUBLICAN os rid during the intermis-\nsion that Schroeder was a much stronger man\nthan Heygster, but that strength alone could\nnot win in such an encounter.\n\n| The second bout, which was according to\npir Fogg rules, lasted only six\nminutes, and was quite hotly contested.\nSchroeder, acting under the advice of his\nfriends, who told him to work quickly and\nforce the fun, went at Bauer impetuously at\n| first; but the latter seemed to play with Rim,\n‘and the audience, seeing this, enjoyed the\nsport. Bauer permitted Schroeder to sieze\nhim almost any way he pleased, and just as\n‘he was about t0 throw him, Bauer would\nquickly force himself free. As this was too\n‘monotonous, however, Bauer put in a little\n‘work. He got a savage neck lock on Schroed-\ner and squeezed his head under his left arm\n‘until the latter groaned with pain, but could\nnot break the lock. With this hold Bauer\nraised him in his arms and swung\nhim around the stage, finally throwing him\nfrom him. Schroeder seemed annoyed at\n‘this and the laughter which the audience in-\ndulged in, added to his discomfort. He\nfought desperately for a zood hold, but could\n‘not obtain one. Suddenly Bauer terminated\n‘the bout by raising Schroeder in his arms by\n‘a waist grip from behind, throwing him on\nthe carpet and falling on his chest, so that\n‘both shoulders touched.

Some six or\nseven hundred persons were in attendance\nincluding the prominent fighting men and\nroughs from all the large cities of the Union,\nmixed with a sprinkling of sporting men,\na few merchants and professional men from\nCincinnati, St. Louis, Louisville and the\nWest.\n\nIt was noticeable how |\n\nFEW FRIENDS\n\nAllen seemed to have—even those from St.\nLouis appeared to be against him; and, in-\ndeed, the only men, with few excentions, who\nchose or dared to express opinions in his favor\nwere in great part those not in any way con-\nnected with the ring or sporting life. Particu-\nlarly was this to be remarked among the\nroughs from New York and the East. Allen's\nwordy contests with Coburn, Rooke, O'Bald-\nwin and others have made him irreconcilable\nenemies who are as dangerous as they are\nnoisy. -\n\nThe English fighting men with few\nexceptions are against him. A man\nnever went into a ring with more\nenemies, and a man less game\nthan Allen would never have dared to do so.\nHis nonchalance is remarkable. It is almost\nfatalism, and while there is very little doubt\nthat he is good enough to\n\nBEAT TWO GOSSES,\n\nIn the same ring, it is more than doubtful if\nhe will be permitted by the New York school\nof roughs to do so.\n\nDespite this feeling a general under-current\nof admiration of the man’s pluck is manifest-\ned. Very few expect Goss to win, but there is\na confidence that he will be able to makea\nstrong rough fight of it for an hour, trusting\nto the chapter of accidents for a chance blow\nlike that which Gallazher gave\nto Allen and defeated him or to a foul blow\nand the decision of the referee, or as last re-\nsource to a general break-up of the ring and\nstealing the fight out of Allen’s hands in this\nWay.\n\nThis is not openly spoken of course, but it is\nas clearly the determination of certain men\nhere that Allen\n\nSHALL NOT WIN.\nThe fight as that the sun has risen on a des-\nperate mob of high-toned roughs, eager for\nblood. If all other ruses fail to stop the fight,\nin the event of its going in favor of the St.\n\nLouis man, a cry of police or militia will be\nraised, and then will come a stampede.\n\nThe ring is pitched in a smooth\n\nPATCH OF CLOVER\n\nAnd all is promising as could well be for a\nfight or a foot-race—on the outside. It would\nbe a good, place for a camp-meeting. This\nisn’t a camp-meeting by a large majority. At\nTa. M.,\n\nTHE MEN ENTERED THE RING.\n\nThe roar for Goss was like the going-offofa\nsmall park of artillery, as he shied his castor\ninside the ropes. Allen also received a share\nof applause, but there was comparatively lit-\ntle heartin it. Both men smiled pleasantly\nand retired to corners, where the process of\nthe toilet was commenced.\n\nTHE TOSS FOR CORNERS\nHaving been decided, the business of the\nday was fairly in order. At\n7:35 the men with their seconds\nadvanced to the centre of the ring. This part\nof a fight is imposing, and has in it a certain\nair of chivalry which, however, is dispelled\nthe next moment. The principals grasp hands,\nand the four seconds shake hands across their\nextended arms. The seconds then retire to\ntheir respective corners and the men are left\nstanding facing each other eager for the fray.\nAPPEARANCE OF THE MEN.\n\nBoth men have paid fair attention to their\ntraining—as Allen always does—but Goss looks\nseedy and aged to a keen observer, notwith-\nstanding all that has been done for him. The\nmarks of a rough life are visible on his battle\nworn face, bat there is a care-devil force\nabout the man that inspires a confidence\nin his backers. He is serious\nand perhaps a little nervous, for it is his first\nfight in America, and he has a desperate con-\ntract before him. Allenisin fine form, clear\nof skin and eyes, and like a rock on his finely\nrounded legs, which are models for a sculp-\ntor. Altogether the comparison is in favor of\nAllen.\n\nROUND ONE.\n\nThe men, left to themselves, eye each other\neagerly and watchfuliy. The positions\nof both men are good, that of Goss being per-\nhaps the more artistic of the two, in a pugil-\nistic sense. He reminds some of the old ring\ngoers of Tom Sayers in position, but the com-\nparison ends there. Both men sparred cau-\ntiously and worked round for an opening.\nTiresome for the crowd. At last Allen led off\nand clinched. They fell in Allen’s corner with\nGoss on top. First blood allowed for Allen.\nTime seven minutes.\n\nROUND RECOND.\n\nBoth men came up quickly and smiling.\nGoss evidently serious and Allen anxious to\nget to work and bustle his man. Tom spars\nquickly and cross counters on Goss’ lip slightly\nin reply to one or two heaviiy on his ribs from\nGoss’ left. Goss staggers and bleeds, and in\nthe wrestle falls under.\n\nROUND THIRD.\n\nClose in-fighting, all in Allen’s favor, and\nGoss under at the finish. The Gossites roars\ning.\n\n3 ROUND FOURTH.\n\nBoth men get to work at once. Exchanges\nare fast and furious. Allen gets in a terrible\nblow on Goss’ neck, which knocks him clean\noff his legs. Time three minutes. Good fight-\ning, but all in favor of the champion.\n\nROUND FIFTH.\n\nThe pace is telling on both. Sparring for\nwind. Allen, as usual, leads off at Goss’\nface, but fails short, and in return receives a\nterrific blow in the stomach, which ought to\nhave sickened him. Tom grins horribly and\nlooks wickedly green about the eyes. He\nsteadies himself for a moment and\nthen delivers his left heavily on\nthe body, and his right by a cross hit\non Goss’ damaged eye, which exhibits signs of\nthe early closing movement. Goss wont be\ndenied, bores his way in, gets in one or two\nlightly on Allen’s body and then they get to\nsharp half-arm hitting, in which Allen has ali\nthe best of it. His blows have more steam in\nthem and the condition of the men is telling.\nGoss goes down to avoid punishment.\n\nROUND SIXTH.\n\nBoth come up quickly and active. No posi-\ntive damage done yet, but the fignt all for\nAllen, barring a foul which the crowd is eager-\nly looking for. Allen gets in viciously on\n\n_ Goss” head, which he repents,being countered\nslightly on the cheek. Allen repeats, and\n&gain sends in another hotone on the damaged\noptie. A desperate rally and in-\nfighting, and Goss is finally fought\ndown. This was the best round in the fight.\nNothing can save the fight to Goss except a\nstroke of lightning, the police or the roughs.\n\nROUND SEVENTH.\n\nOn time being called the men stood up in\ntheir corners, but the Covington Light Guard\nmade their appearance at the ring side, and\nthe fight was stopped. A hasty flizht is in |\nprogress, and it is believed that the fight will H\nbe renewed as soon as a place of safety can be\nreached.\n\n——p—\n[Associated Press Report.\nThe Goss-Allen Prize Fight.\n\nCINCINNATI, Sept. 7.—The point chosen for\nthe fight between Allen and Goss, is a clover\nfield near Walton, Ky., on the Louisville Short\nLine railroad, 18 miles from Cincinnati.

This did not\nappear to WOITY Allen and he\nreturned heavily on Goss’ body, and gave him\na fearful one on his damaged eve.

M.—It has been deterinined that\nSheriif Percival, accompanied by City Marshal\nBolan, Capt. Frank Wood and ten of his com-\npany, shall go to Walton, on the Short line,\nnear which piaceit is supposed the fight is to\ncome off. An extra engine and car containing\nthe party will start from the depot at Newport\nin about an hour. Itis expected that detach-\nments of militia from other portions of the\nstate will rendezvous at that point, who will\ngive their aid to the civil authorities in arrest-\ning the principals, seconds and abettors of the\nfight.\n\n8215. dispatch just received from the\nFoy enor orders the full company to leave\n\nor Walton on the first convenient train. Asit\nis now discovered that an extra train is not to\nbe had, and no regular train leaves until six\no'clock, two nours behind the time appointed\nfor the excursion train io start, it seems prob-\nable that the fight will be over before the Cov-\ngto party can get to the spot.\nyoss and Allen slept in Cincinnati at the Gib-\nson house last night, and were to\ntake the four o’clock train (the last\none) with their seconds, Tom Kelly and\nArthur Chambers for Allen and Barney Aaron\nand John Dwyer for Goss. On this train were\nto go the managers, the reporters and aid who\nfind purchased seven-dollar tickets.\nDEPARTURE OF THE FIRST TRAIN.\n\nAt an early hour this morning two trains\nwere put into the Little Miamidepot. One con-\nsisted ot nine passenger cars and a caboose,\nmost of the coaches beingshort,banty arrange-\nments, belonging to the Louisvilie and Indi-\nanapolis company, and the others venerable\naffairs, with dingy paint and of a nondescript\ncharacter.\n\nAt 2 o'clock a large and motley crowd had\ngathered into the depot, the large majority\n\neing young fellows belonging to the ‘boys, ””\nand not possessing tickets, but depending on\ntheir chances of getting to the fight.\n\nA little after 2 o'clock an attempt was made\nto load the irain with ticket-holders. But as\nsoon as the first ear was opened the roughs\ncrowded in and jammed it full. About fifty\nclimbed in at the windows after the car was\nalready overcrowded, and a large number\nscrambled to the roof. It was then announced\nthat tickets would be collected after the train\nhad reached Newport; and the cars were\nthrown open. Not zil were filled when, ata\nquarter past 2, the train was pulled out. It was\nnot known where it would stop, but\nknowing ones asserted that it\nwould not reach the place of the\nfight, and that those in it holding tickets, as\nwell as those without, wouid be fooled in\nboarding it. Most of the ticket-holders quiet-\n1y remained behind, seeming to understand\nthar the HArst train went out to carry off the\n‘‘bums.””’\n\nThere was no disturbance at the depot up to\nthe starting of the first train, though many\nhad begun to pull freely on their whiskey\nflasks, and were getting pretty drunk. A\nstrong force of police were in attenaance. The\nofficers. however, were ordered to keep back\nout of the depot, and not to interfere with the\ncrowd except in case of a serious trouble.\n\nee\nRecord of the Men.\n\nThe record of each of the principals in to-\nday’s fight is a somewhat extended one, and,\nin connection with the account of tune inter-\n\nrupted battle five above, may prove of in-\nterest. The following ccndeused history of\nthe men was lately prepared by the Cincinnati\n\nnguirer:\nTOM ALLEN\n\nComes from a fighting family and a fighting\n\nll ” !\n\nean ee in merrv England. When !\na youth he learned the trade of gun-making.\n\n| During the Crimean war he entered the |\narmy, and it was his good luck in a\nnumber of ‘‘turn-ups’’ that he had in\nfront of Sevastopol that convinced him that he\nhad the stuff in him out of which champions |\nare made. On his return to England he tested\nthe matter with Jack White for £5 a side. The\nresult was satisfactory to Allen, so he next\ntackled Morris Conner for £10 aside. He got\nthe best of Morris in twenty-two rounds and\nfifty minutes.\n\nIn September, 1861, he beat Jack Gould for\n£15 a side in fifty-one rounds and\n\n| one hour and twenty-two minutes.\nHall of Portsmouth was his next\n| opponent. The match was for £25 a side, and\nwas won by the conquering Allen in fifteen\nrounds and forty-two minutes. Tom's next\n| vis-a-vis in the ring was Goss’ old opponent, |\n| Posh Price. The fight was for £10 a side, and\nwas won by Price in twenty-two rounds and\nfifty-five minutes. ‘Bingy’’ Rose nextlowered\n| his colors to Alien for £25 a side In ten rounds |\nand twenty-two minutes.\n\ni Allen next met the American darky Bob\n\n{ Smith; who was a thoroughbred, ii Lie was a\n\n1 ““nagur.’’ They fought tor £5 a side, and the\nbattie was wazed tunrough one hunared and\n\n| eirht rounds, oceupring three hours and fifty- |\nseven minutes, at the end of which time Allen\nwas defeated.\n\nJack Parkison and Tom next hed a “‘go’’ at\neach other for £25 a side. After fighting}\nhres rounds in twenty minutes, Jack con- i\ncluded that he had had enough of Tow’s terri- |\nble ‘‘left,”” and he gave in.\n\nAllen now tried his old conqueror Posh\nPrice, this time for £50 a side, and aiter mill-\ning forty-five rounds in two hours and ilve\nminutes, Tom was proclaimed the victor.\n\nGeorge lles, who fought O’'Baldwin, the\nIrish Giant, was Alien’s next customer. They\nmet for £100 a side, and after fifteen rounds\nand fifty-two mintues had been consumed,lles\nwas defeated.\n\nJoe Goss was Allen's next competitor, with\nresult above stated. After fighting Go s, Allen,\nin company with the celebrated feather-weight,\nPeter Morris, came to this country, arriving\nhere in 1867. His first fight in America was\nwith Old Bill Davis for $1,000 a side. It oc-\ncurred in January, 1869, and was won with\nease by Allen in forty rounds and 40 minutes.\n\nCharley Gallagher of Cleveland was Allen's\nnext opponent. They fought for $1,000\naside in 1569. Allen thought he\nhad a soft thing, and in “‘kidding’’ Gal-\nlagher gave himself away, and Charley\nput him to sleep in two rounds and three min-\nutes.\n\nMike McCoole and Tom next fought for$1,000\nin June ot 1869. Allen had the best of the\nfight all through, but the crowd cut the ring\nto pieces and the fight was'drawn after seven\nrounds, in fourteen minutes, had been fought.\n\n= fourth fight in 1869 was wih Charley\nGallagher for $1,000 aside. This tine he\nturned the tables on Gallagher and whipped\nhim in seventeen rounds and twen-\niy-two minutes. He next fought\nJem Mace near New Orleans\nfor $1,500 a side. Mace won in ten\nrounds and forty-four minutes. Jim Gallagher |\nthought at this time that he was Tom's mas-\nter, and he matched himself against him for |\n$500 a side. He wasn’t common amusement |\nto Allen, however, for he thumped him to a\nstand-still without half wrying in fifteen\nrounds and twenty-two minutes. In December\nof 1870 Mike McCoole, who had again been\nmatched against Allen, forfeited $1,000 and\nthe match was off. A fresh match tor $2,500 was\nmade between the parties in 1873, and in Sep-\ntember of that year they met near St. Lonis\nand fought eight rounds in nineteen minutes,\nwhen Mike was beaten. Bea Hogan next had\nthe temerity to meet Ailen for $1,000 aside,\nbut in three rounds, occupying but six min-\nutes, he was done for. George Rooke of New-\nark, last year matched himself to fight Tom for\n£1.500 aside, but at the last moment his heart\nfaiied him and he did not put in an appear-\nance. After considerable wrangling it was at\nlast agreed to draw the stakes.\n\nJOE GOSS\n\nWas born in Northampton, in England, No-\nvember 6, 1S36. le is consequenily in his\nfortieth year, though, but for a slight bald-\nness, he would not look his age by five years.\nHis father Kept a large shoe-making establish-\nment, and at the proper age he learned cord-\nwaining. It was this experience, perhaps,\nthat haus enabled him to last so well in his\nfights, and to weit the larger portion of his op-\nponents, causing them to peg out well basied.\nIn his youth he proved a tough bit ot stuif, as\nmany of his townsmen have cause to know,\nand, early developiug a decided predilection\nfor the ring, he found friends without trouble\nto back him for £5 against George Ayers of\nLong Berkley. He was then but nineteen\nyears of age, but he beat Ayers to a stand-stili\nin one hour and thirty minutes.\n\nHe next met Jem Rickerson for £10 a side.\nJust when victory was within his grasp the\npolice interfered and stopped thie mill. Goss\nreceived £17 of the stake money the next day\nto consent to make the match a draw.\n\nJoe was next matched against Jack Rooke,\nand fought hin in the same ring where Tom\nSavers put the ‘‘comether’” on poor\nBob Brettle. This battle Was for\n£25 a side, and was won cleverly by Joe.\nTom Price of Bilson now intimated that he\nwas ready to match Joe if the latter would\nstake £10 to £8. Joe bad no objections. They\nmet, and Joe again walked off the victor.\nCharly Patchet of Wolverhampton thougit\nlie po.s_ssed the ability to take the shine out\nof Sir Joseph, and a match for £20 was the\nresult. It didn’t take Joe long to\nconvince Charley that ha was mis-\ntaken. Goss bad now made quite a repu-\ntation as a quick game fighter, and his\nfriends matclied him against the celebrated\nBodger Crutchley for £100 a side. This was\na terrible battle, lasting over three hours, but\nvictory again perched on Goss’ brow. Joe\nwas soon thought good enough to fight any\nman in England, and Le next met Bill Riall, a\n‘*big un,’’ who had fought for the champion-\nship. The stakes were £50 a side, and Goss\nwon in two hours and fifty minutes. Riall was\nnot satisfied with his defeat,and a fresh match\nfor £100 was the result. In the third round\nGoss broke the ‘‘scuifle’’ bone of his rizht\nshoulder. The police tien interfered, and an\nadjournment had to be made to another coun-\nty. Here they fought for an hour and twenty\nminntes, when they were again chased by the\npeelers, who ran them into the river. They\ngot away, however, and met toe third time.\nAfter fighting until dark came on the match\nwas made a draw.\n\nPosh Price, one of the best men who ever\npuiled off a shirt in England, was Joe’s next |\nopponent. They tought for £25 a side, and,\nthough punished feariully, Joe's pluck and\nstamina pulled him through successfully. He\nhad now so much coniidence in himself that he\nbantered the renowned Jem Mace for a\nmatch, only asking that the Gypsy give him\nthe odds of six io four on the stakes.\nMace, nothing loth, assented, and staked £600\nto £400 and the championship. Joe at last had\ngone too far, and for the first time in his ca\nreer he was compelled to ery peccavi, and ac-\nknowledge himself beat. Ike Baker at this\ntime thought that Joe’s star had began to de-\ncline, and he tackled him for £100 a side.\nGoss convinced bim to iis heart’s content that\nhis cake was dough, and the doughty Baker\nwas glad to cry, ‘‘Hold, enough!’’\n\nGoss now came to the conclusion\nthat if he pursued other tac-\ntics with Mace than those he had\nadopted before, be might be able to get the\nbest of him, and a second match for £200 a\nside and the championship, was made be-\ntween Mace and he. After fighting over an\nhour this battle was declared a draw. Joe\nnaturally felt consideraly elated over his last\nmatch, and when bantered to meet Macein a\nsixteen-foot ring, he foolishly assented, and a\nthird match was made between them for £100\naside. Joe had no opporiunity to\n‘get away’’ from Mace's attacks in these cir-\ncumscribed limits. And the result was that he\nwas again licked.\n\nHis next match was for £100 a side, and his\nopponent was Tom Allen. Goss had been sent\nto jail tor thirty days for seconding a man in a\nprize-fight, and only got out tiie day before he\nmet Alien. The fight was a good one, &nd\nlasted until night came on, when a craw\nwas made of it. Joe seemed to\nLike dghting the Allen tamily\nso well that he next matched himself with\nTom's brother Harty for £179 a side, but the\npolice apprehended Harry,and the gut never\ncaine off. For a number of years Goss has\nbeen “‘‘on the shelf’ as far as active participa-\ntion in ring aifairs has been concert ¢d, though\nhe hes made seversl sparving tours through\nEngland znd the prov.iaces, and has never\nbeen averse to meeting the bést men that the\nUnited Kingdom could produce. He came to\nthis country with Jem Mace last spring, and\nhis subsequent career is well known.\n\n—",

Sleep, Sherif of this\n\n| (Boone) county, appeared in the ring,\n\n| but took no action looking towards the\n\n| stopping of the tight.\n\n| Eizhth Round—After the ring had\n\nheen arranged, word was sent to the\ntwo men. Goss was first to respond to\nthe summons. He had a blotch over the\nright eye, and showed some slight signs\nof the punishment received during the\nmorning. After some sparring Allen |\nsot in on Goss’ face and drew blood.\nGoss countered on Allen's body, then |\n\n{ there was a clinch and Goss fell.\n\nNinth Round—Alter considerable |\nsparring Allen got squarely on Guss' |\nnose. Allen got in on Goss’ breast,\nand Goss on Allen’s face. Goss seems\n\n| to be feeling his punishment, and his\n\n| left eye is nearly closed. The round\n\n{ closed by Allen tighting Goss down.\n\nTenth Round—After rapid exchanges,\nthe men clinched in Allen's corner and |\nwere separated by the referee.\n\nEleventh Round—Fighting sharp and\n\n| furious and in favor of Allen. The men\n\n| =o down at the ropes. Goss’ eyes are\nrapidly closinz.\n\n| Twelfth Round—3oss  foreed the\n\nfichting, and a low blow was struck. A\n\n| claim ef foul was made but not allowed.\n\n( The round was decided in Allen's favor,\n\n| (ross commences to show his punish-\n\n| ment badly. Allen has received some\nheavy body blows but his face has\n\nscarcely been marked,\n\n| Thirteenth Round—Goss came up\n\npromptly, but his eyes seemed to he\n\n| closicg fast. Allen appeared contident |\n| aud forced the tizhting. After rapid\n\ni exchanges Allen Zot square in |\n\n| on Goss’ demaged face and knocked him |\n\nsquarely down, It now looks as if Al\n\n| len had the fight in his own hands.\n\ni Fourteenth Round—After considera-\n\nble sparring, the men clinched, and Al- |\n\nlen was thrown over the ropes. A claim\n\nof foul was raised by Goss’ friends, hut |\nwas not recognized.\n\n| Fifteenth Round—The fighting was\n\n{ fast and fearful. Goss was nearly biind.\n\nAllen Knocked him squarely off his\n\n| feet. |\n\nSixteenth Round =This was all in\n| favor of Allen. |\n\nSeventeenth Round—The fighting was\n| furious and a claim was made that Allen\nstruck Goss after he was down, and it\nwas allowed by the referee. The fight\nwas, therefore, miven to Goss. It looks\nas if there might be trouble before the\npuriy get home,\n\nGoss Blind.\n\nA train bringing Allen and witnesses\n\n| of the tizht arrived in Newport at 3\n\n| o'clock. Goss, entirely blind and un- |\n\n| able to travel, was left behind. On leav- |\n\n| ing the car, Allen was arrested and is\nnow in Newport jail.

Near the banks of that\nriver that has been more sung, and more mud-\ndy, than any driblet of water on the top of this\ndoubted round globe, at Barnet, on the\nThames, is the gallant Tom in training, and\nundergoing ‘‘a course of sprouts’’ from his\n“Coach’' Jack Hopkins. Tom ‘‘peels’’ well,\nand shows up a fine, glossy, clear, cutaneous\ncoat. HIs ease, elasticity, and arm elance are\nmanifestly ine—I may say, to quote ‘‘all En-\nland’ '—the most slangy nation of creation—\nthat he is ‘‘all there'’ and ‘‘quite fit’’ as well\ngs ‘‘in form.'* He stands well and firm, and\nwould delight Charles Reade, the most insane\npsychologieal novelist, in illustrations of free-\ndom of his ‘‘left hand *’ |\n\nHis power of oppugn isin ‘‘fine form,’’ and\nwould draw tears of admiration from that one |\ntearful eye of Picayune Butler, or cause that |\nmuch cared for and well-nursed mustache of\ndoubtful honest proportions—that cheeky\nmustachie—ot General Logan to stand on end,\neach very particular hair, like the fretted quills\nof an euraged porcupine.\n\nTom Allen, so well known to all of yoursport-\ning rcaders—and, by the by, he sends a general\ngreeting to Cincinnati—is well in hand, and will\nbe ready for the conquest, the belt, ‘and the\nmon«y two,\" in the course of fourteen or six-\nteen davs hence.

In America he\nproved his ability in that mechanism, and\nwight have made a fortune if the *‘funcy’’ did\nnot entice him away, and his *‘serappings’’\nlead Lun into devions paths. He fougnt Tom\nHiuss¢ + at Boston for $300 and ‘*Perquis’’ the\nfirst year of bis landing in America, and he\nvanqui-bed Hussey, but with ‘‘no margins to\ncarry over,'' as less chivalrous champions of\nthe Stock Exchange say. He next tackled C.\nCollins, of the eity of London, then in America\nalso, for $1,000, and after some tough time of\nit, in one hour and twenty-five minutes the\nlittle zame ended in a ‘‘foul,’’ Collins being\nknocked into ‘‘smithereens.'’ It was said,\nLut 1 won't say how correctly, that ‘‘Boss'’\nEL. Corker had crookedly ‘‘squared’’ the\naffair. After this, Rooke had a little deal\nwith a card named Mat Moore for $2,000 and\nthe middle-weight championship. Moore was a\n“‘pufled up'’ pug, and in one hour and four\nminutes came to grief and cried *‘Turkey'’\nplain. Then Rooke took to Jack Smith, of\ndem in a private vis-a-vis for $500 and\nintweaty minutes, or six rounds, Jack went\ninto a camera obscura, his *‘photo \"' being spoil -\ned for nn Adonis. Rooke, by this time, went\nrejoicing on his way from New York to Chicago\nund St. Louis, and back to Cincinnati, etc.,\nlike a roaripg lion seeking whom he may de-\nvour. Many ot your readers will recall the\nsreat excitement sad general ‘‘bobbery’’ at\n| SpA Lake, Wilkesbarre, Penn., when\nRooke stepped out of the cars one fine morning\nto meet Jem Coyne for $2,000 and to the\namazement of all the said Jem sat on his\nhaunclhies in the ring and stubbornly declined\nto move or fight. Rooke walked over ihe turf, |\nand some tall talk prevailed. |\n\nTom Allen also shortly after agreed to meet\nRooke ior $2,500) and the championship ot\nAuwericia, but there was a difficulty abouts the\nstakeholders, and the affair fell through.\nAbout eighteen months ago Rooke returned to\nEngiund and met Hugh Burns st New Market\nin an cif hand *‘Corinthian’' dibble-dabble of\nnot uch account one afod fe the other, end-\nsina draw.

Inthe days when\nALLENAND M'COOLE’S\nstabli-timents fourislied here each man had\n\n* cugne, and when the first great\nintch was made between these two rivals the\n“acitement among the partisans of both was\nintense, Each party vowed their man was the\n\nv8' und gamest one of the two, words were\napdicd back and forth, and barrels of wealth\nwire put upon the final result. The excite-\nnent and betting were contagious, and soon\ngood and trane citizens who hitherto hadq\nlocked upon the prize ring as beneath their no-\ntun caught the fever, and talked of nothing\nit ‘Sght,’ as well as backing their\ninion with the filthy lucre.\nIle ladies too had their favorite, and\nwngerea gloves, fans, etc., as to who would\n“one ont first bestin the fight. It was in May\nnthe year 1869 when papers were duly drawn\n‘p and signed by Tom Allen and Mike McCoole,\nwhereby these two giants were to enter the\nroped arena and engage in a fair stand-up\nfight according to the rules of the London\nprize ring. The stake was to be §1,000 a side,\nand the 15th dayof June was named as the\ndate.’\n\nA reference to the rattling mill will prove of\n€nterest to St. Louisans,as well as to many oth-\ners who remember the stirring incidents on the\nriver in connection with\n\nTHE FIGHT.\n\nMecCoole had for his seconds Jerry Donovan\nand Tom Kelly, while Butt Riley and Sher.\n‘Thurston waited upon bis opponent. Jack\nLooney stood umpire for Mae, Steve Halloran\nfor Allen, and Val McKinney officiated as ref-\ncree. The battle geound selected was Foster's\nIsiund, which les twenty-six miles below this\n“iy. At that time the friends of McCoole were\n\n{21 more numerous than those of Allen, and as\n“heir tavorite enteced the ring he was greeted\nwith loud and prolonged cheers, while few\n“lees were raised to greet Tom, it being\n‘vilent that the sympathy of the crowd was\nMFiely on the other side of the house. After\n‘Ue men had disrobed, MeCoole, with an air of\nYprzadocio, walked over to Allen's corner,\n=o, producing a roll of notes, offered to wager\n£1,900 on the result, to which Tom replied that\nlie bad no money; these words were hailed\nWiliterewed cheers for Mike and hissed for\n«lien. At this\n\nALLEN,\n\n#9¢ing how the crowd was against him, rose to\nLs feet, and, raising his hand to\n“tpoin silence, maid: *‘Gentlemen, I\nLave yp money, or I would freely bet\ni Aad I am very sorry that so much prejudice\n\n‘in regard to my nationality. I declared\nAf tention to become a citizen of the United\np “8two years ago, and, if you will give me\nime enough, I will prove myself as worthy a\ncitizen as any of you. Icame here to-lay to |\nfight this gentlemen, and all I ask of you is to\ngive me a fair show. Iask no favors. Ihave\nno money, but I am going to try to win some,\nand will do my best.” This manly\nspeech was applauded by a ftew,\nbat had little effect on the vast\nmajority, who were blinded by\n\nPrejudice and admiration for their man\nSeventeen rounds wers fought, and at the end\nMcCoole was terribly used up, but his friends,\nwho were determined he shouid win at all haz-\nards, flourished their revolvers and kmves,\nand gave utterance to all kinds of dire threats\nwith a view to intimidate Allen. And in the\nlast round cries of ‘‘toul,’’ ““foml,’’ “‘he’s\ngouging,’’ etc., were raised by the McCoole\nparty, and the excited mass covered the fight-\ning ground; clubs were wiclded promiscuously.\nwhile the referee was besieged by\nenraged men, armed with murderous weapons,\nwho savagely and. threateningly demanded a\ndecision in favor of MeCoole. The referee re-\nfused to give his decision then, but the next day\nthe local papers published the following\n\n. DECISION,\nwhich, though so unjust, did not cause much\nsurprise, as it was pretty well understood that\nMcCoole was to receive the money:\n* Br. J.ovis, Mo., June 15, 1869.\n\nI, Valentine McKinney, give my decision in\nthe late fight between McCoole and Allen, in\nfavor of McCoole, a foul being commited by\nAllen on McCoolein the last round by gouging\nhis eyes.\n\nVAL. MCKINNEY.\n\nThus ended the most exeiting and bloody fist\nfight that ever took place near St. Louis. The\nfriends of Allen were terribly dissatisfied ag\nthe deceision of the referee, and yearned for\nrevenge, which they soon got to their thorough\nsatisfuction, another match being made be-\ntween the two, for $2,500 a side and the cham-\npionship of America. It took place on the\ntenth day of November of the same year and\nlasted just seventeen rounds. In thag\nfight Allen cut ap his adversary\nterribly, causing the sponge to be thrown up in\nhis behalf, while Tom escaped without a visi-\nble scratch and only one severe body blow.\nThis ght came off as Chouteau Islana and will\nlong be remembered by the sporting fraternity\nwho attended the picnic. Since this fight the\nold timers have been taking a rest, and no two\nlieuvy weiglits have come together sinee\nthen, with the exception of the\nfiasco between Mace and Coburn near\nNew Orleans, when both siood in the ring\nfacing each other for hours without striking\na blow. The descision of the referee in this\ncase was that one was afraid\nand the other daren't. To-day\nthe pugs call Gotham their headquar.\nters and at Harry Hill’s well-known resort\ncan be seen, on benefit nights, the remains of\nthe pugilistic fraternity.",

It is\nnot easily fooled, and only a verv short period\nof double dealing and bad faith is necessary\nto break up patronage bestowed onsport of any\nkind. That the fight at New Orleans yester-\nday was conducied on honest principles\nthere is no reason to doubt, and however re-\npulsive the spectacle may be, of two men |\nbeating each other out of shape, there can be |\nno doubt but that the general interest taken\nin the affair has been of more than passing\nmportance.\n\nYesterday Mr. Sullivan, of Boston, knocked\nMr. Ryan, of Troy, into a state of insensibil-\nity in twenty-six minutes, after one of the\n“camest’’ contests on record; thus carrying\nout the predictions of the POST-DISPATCH\nsporting editor, that the battle would be\nshort and decisive. A retrospect is exceed-\ningly timely, and there are\nsome very interesting reminiscences\nto be recdlled regarding pugilism\nin America. Perhaps ring fighting had no\nincentive in the eountry until the National\nAmerican movemeut sprang up and then the\n‘‘native’’ element was in the field for ag-\ngressive movement on every point. Cath-\noliec churches were riddled, engines and hose\ncarts run bv Americans, such as the Vigi\nlance and Shiffler in Philadelphia attacked\nthe Hibernia and Mavamensing companies,\nmounted by firenen of Celtic origin. Th:\nstreets of Baltimore ran with blood, the Dead\nRabbits and Bowerv Bovs fought for davs\nand mights in New York streets; Macready,\nthe English aetor,was driven from the boards\nof the A-<tor Place Opera House, New York,\nand the militia had to be called out to sup-\npress one of the bloodiest riots on re\ncord. Bill Poole and his confreres were\nheld up as models for emulation for our\nyouth, and when the former was shot by\nLewis Baker—Iliving seven days with a ball in\nhis brea-t—the Government took enough in-\nterest ip the matter to send a man of-war af-\nter th~ ageressor and ca ture him in the An-\ntipodes. Those were indeed stirring times:\nds ys of a riotous family strife, which had ne\nplace in history, but in which no man had s\n\nfe place outside of his own doors. *“Pau-\n\n«ws 1” was murdered; John Morrissey, a\n\nizhting stevedore, was held on a hot stove,\n\nuntil pain made him exert himself and secat-\nter his dozen or so antagonists like as mans\n\nchips. .\n\nIu these mild, poetical and cheerful davy-\nguch men as Frank Ambrose—known to his-\ntory as Yankee Sullivan—and Tom\nHyver came to the front as national\nantagonists. Their friends made a maten\nand on February 7, 1849, they fought for tne\nlargest stake ever put up, $10,060. The bat=\ntie was at Rock Point, Maryland, and Hyer,\nwho represented the American faction, was\nthe winner after a vicious battle. About thi\nperiod Chris Lilly, Hammer Lane, Orville\nGardner, Lar Bieral and scores of others\nwere note for their exploits in the ring and\nbattles were numerons and hard fought.\n\nANEW ERA\n\nwas thatin which Morrisey, who had long\n\nranked as a good fighter in any shape, rough\n\nand tumble or according to the ring rules,\nand John C. Heenan tigured. Heenan wa-\nknown as the *‘Benicia B-y,”’ and despite hi- |\n\nHibernian origin ranked as the repre- |\n\nsentative of the Americiwn element. Hi-\nnick-name was derived from the place of his\nbirth, Benicia, Cal.,, where he worked\nas a blacksmith and laid the foundation for\none of the gr ndest physiques ever given to\nmortal man. A match was made bei ween\nthem, the stakes being $5,000. The battle\ntook place at Long Point, Canada, on\nOctober 20, 1858, and the excitement at the\ntime was most iotense and puisated rhrough\nthe nation. Heenan was trained too fine, and\nthe reduction was such thas a terrible boil\nshowed on his neck. He made no complain:\nbut fought with the nerve and strength that\nonly a natural gladiator could have exhibited\nunder the circumstances. He punished\nMorrissey terribly, but the hard head of the\n“Hon. John” received the biows as though it\nwas made of rock. The fight was a short\none, and although Heenan was whipped\nhe showed such stuff that it was\nvirtually rezarded as a victory for him Dur\ning their famous match Heenan had the good\nservices of Aaron Jones, an ex-Eagzlish\nchampion. Morrissey retired after this, but\nin the subsequent battle between Heenan\nand Sayers, fought at Farnborough, England,\nin 1860, he was notable from the fact that he\nsided with the Euglishman against his old\nantagonist, which created a very bitter feel-\ning against him, and the impression of which\nhe was many vears eradicating in New York.\nThe Farnborough fizzle, in which Heenan\nwhipped Sayers almost to a standstill—at\nwhich point a mob broke in and robbed the\nAmerican of his laurels, is a matter of pugi-\ntistic record. Heenan afterwards fought\nTom King, the Euglish champion afterwards,\nbut was defeated. by him. Hee-\nnan was out of condition and\nalthough he never ‘‘squealed’’ it was openly\nasserted that he was given “painted’’ food\nthe morning of the fight. About this period\nEdmund Price and ‘‘Austrahian” Kelly\nfought, the former beating the latter and\nbreaking a eouple of his ribs. Price is now\na rather prominent legal practitioner 1n\nWashington courts. On dit one of the\ngreatest ovations ever offered to mortal man\nwas given to Heenan in July, 1860, after his\nreturn from England after his Savers fizht.\nThis was at Jones Woods, New York, and\nupon a raised stage he  greigiens with Prof.\nOtutignon in presence of a multitude, so\nlarge that only a small portion of it could\npossilby see the exhibition. From morn al-\nmost to dewy eve, the street cars struggled\nalong under the burden of buma nity\nwhich crowded not oniv the interiors\nand platforms, but the very roofs, and scores\nclung to the windows from the outside.\nHenry Bergh’s siar had not then arisen.\n\nHeenan died about eleven years ago, and, it\nmust be said, m' ¢h regretted by those who\nknew him. He bad many manly qualities,\nand was in private a quiet and inoffensive\nman. At the time of his death he was a suc-\ncessful gambler in New York, be and his old\nadversary, Morrissey, having fallen into the\nsame lope of business. Morrissey’s political\nlife was well known, and he was noted for\nhis fidelity to his friends, to his faith in his\nown word and for owning the most brilliant\n\nmbling house ever instituved 1n America.\nHe was a great Jose player, and there is a\n\nextant of his having sat down to alittle\nbh t game with Ben Wood, proprietor of the\nNew York Daily News, which lasted three\ndays and nights, and in whieh\n| A COOL $100 000\nchanged hands. Long previous to this Joe\nCoburn’s name was as familiar as a house-\nhold word in New York and 8 a bar room\nfichter, and as a very expert and scientific\nsparrer he gained some renown all over the\ncountry. Coburn came of a fighting famiiv.\nhis brother Mickey b:ing a splendid licht-\nweight fighter, his cousin Dick, a clever man\nwith his fists alrhouzh he never aspirea to\nhonors in that direction; while his older\nbrother known as *‘the ould fellow?\n111 over Gntham had been identi.\nfied with ring matters for many years. Joe\nkept a “house of cal’? on Grand street near\nBroadway, and there many handsome dis\nplays were seen. it was almost impossible\nro drop in there of a Saturday night withou:\nfinding a score of such men as Dick Holly-\nwood, *‘‘the Nonpa-eil,”” Dabiin Trick,\nOwney Geoghegan, Denny Harrigan, Dave\nweCarthy, Johnny Lazarus, Barney\nAaron and others of that pe\nriod, and from that point light-weight\nfighting became popular, and the hard-fought\nnattles hetween Barney Owen and Sam.,Cul\nver,and Biily Edwards with both of them he-\ncame matters of importantrecord in the hstory\nof the ring. Coburn’s fir-t great battle was\nwith Mike McCoole, and og Bion science\nwon for him. It was a hard fight and MeCoole\ntook his punishment like a glutton. It re-\nquired sixty-seven rounds, occupying one\nbour and ten minutes to bring it to a conclu-\nsion. Coburn challenged the English cham-\npion Tom King, as a sort of avenger for Hee-\nnan, but King, after beating Mice in one of\nthe best batties ever fought in England, this\nNovember 26, 1862, retired from the ring.\nMace made a match with Goss and knocked\nhim out of time, the fluht taking place the\nvear following. Coburn made a match with\nMace to fizht in Ireland, and after the men\nhad almost come together there was a\ntechnical dispute over the referee. Mace left\nIrelana the night before the fight was to have\ntaken place.\nTHERE WAS A RESPITE\nin the interest taken in prize ring matters\ntor a long time, the war being in progress.\nDunn and Davis, two ER of the second\ngrade, had a meeting néar Port Jarvis, N. J.,\n1865, Dunn winning. The influx of Eaglish\npugs to this country became something\nnotabie. Dooney Harris, a scienced fighter,\nhad already come here. Billy Ryali and\nPeter Morris, English light weight champion,\nand Tom Allen arrived here on\none invoice and they were followed\nby the Hickens’ and afterwards Ned\nO’Baldwin, the Irish giant. About this\nperiod Charlie Gallagher, a voung Califor-\nnian, came to the front as a fighter, and had\n<everal hard fights. Bill Davis whipped him\nnear Detroit in 1867. From this period prize\nfighting fell into disrepute, matches were\nmade and failures to meet were demonstra-\ntive of cowardice or *‘skins.” In 1868 there\nwas some little stir over a challenge from\nJohn C. Heenan to fight McCoole; this was\ndeclined. About this period, however, sev-\neral verv hard fights did take place. In 1869\nTom Allen whipped Bill Davis, Charlie Gal-\nlagher defeated Tom Allen at Carroll Island,\nnear this city, and in June McCool and Allen\ncame together at Boster’s [siand, and after\nMcCool was well whipped the fight was\nbroken up. In August, 1869, Allen took\nhis revenge out on Gallagher, whipping him\nvery bad.y.\nJEM MACE,\nperhaps the greatest of fistic notabilities since\nHeenan, had come to America. He was of\nZipsy origin, a sparrer withont a rival and\nwho could use defense with the quickest hit-\nters without putting up his bands, His head\nmovements and ducking were something\nwhich took the averaze boxers’ breath away,\nnothing like it was ever seen. Tom Allen\nwas now to the front of pugilists in this\ncountry, and a match was made between\nthem. They fought at Kennerville, near\nNew Orleans, in 1870, far Jee a side. In\nthis great battle Heenan as umpire for\nMace, Dad Byan for Allen; Jno. ]\n|\n| Sherman Thurston seconded Allen and Jim |\nCusick and Jerry Donovan served for Mace. |\nThe ciose of-this terrible battle is thus des |\ncribed by an eye witne-s: “For tea rounds |\nit was a hard battle of tactics. Allen got the\nfir~t knock down, this in the ninth round.\n\nThe tenth round was one of tbe most!\n\nfurious struggles at half arm I ever\n\naw. It was terrible, give and take |\nand finally the clinch came. Mace’s great |\n1-ility as a wrestler stood him in good pead |\nnow, and afier a brief struggle ae threw Allen |\n1 complete somessault. Alen reil cu bi- |\nright shoulder and Mace fell heaviiy on him.\nAllen was inseansible, and Coburn threw up |\nthe sponge. It as feared for some tiw\nthat Allen’s neck was broken, but after a\ntime he recovered. Mice opened a sporting |\nerib on a grand scale, “The\nCapital,’ opposite Booth’s Tuea~\nter on Twenty-third street, New York.\nIt did not pan out well and\nseveral very notable renconftres took\nplace there. It was in that place that John\nMorrissev and Cooley Keves were going to\nhave their pistol duel, and on the evening of\nNovember 7, 1870, Joe Coburn sauntered in\nthere a little the worse for wine, and, after\nhis manner when in his cups, on mischief\nbent. He evidently remembered his old\ntrouble with Mice, and Coburn aid everv-\nthing to br nz about a fight, which dace ac\ncepted with good nature and would not lis-\nten to. “Go and hit him in the nose, Joe,”\nwas the advice given by one of the\nCoburn party, and Joe deliberately did so.\nThere was a prospect of who was the better\nman being decided then and there, but friends\nTatytiated. and the partizans who were in\nthe scheme vrged Mace to make a mateh. He\ndid so, and they agreed to tight for $1,000 a\nside. After being militated out of Canada, a\nfresh match was made for $2 500 a side and\nthe ch:+mpionshin of the world. They met\nNovember 80, 1871, at Bav St. Louis, not far\nfrom where yesterday’s battle took place,\nMace being seconded by Jim Cusick and Tom\nAlien, Coburn by Tom Kelly and Tom Me A=\npine. Mace’s u npire was Al. Smith;\nCoburn’s, his older brother Jim. Rufus\nHunt was referee. The fight took place in a\ncold, beating shower of rain. It was a batile\nof tac'ics from the start. Mace drew blood\nfrom Coburn’s eye in the fourth round. in\nthe first, cecond, ninth and eleventh rounds\nthey clinched, Coburn having the best of the\nrounds. In the fifth round both fell over the\nropes while struggling for the fali. The men\nbecime slyer and slyer, and in the twelfth\nround they sparred and danced around each\nother for nearly an hour. Coburn had the\nbest of it, but would not force the fighting,\nand Mace would not leave his corner. After\nthis monkey business for a long time the re-\nferee entered the ring and declared the fizht\na dra. Although three hours and a half were\nconsumed neither showed great marks of pun-\n{shment, and the fizzle was provocative of\ngreat diszust amongst the admirers of the\nmanly art. Ned O’Ba'dwin,\n\nTHE IRISH GIANT,\n\nwho had arrived in this country some months\nprevious, and who had an interrupted fight\nwith Ned Wormald, another imported pug—\nboth men serving for a short time\nfor the offence—was then matched\nto fight with Mace. This ended in another\nfizzle. By this time prize fighting had re-\nceived a very general black eye, and there\nwere but few movements of note for some\ntime. Mace went to E: gland, afterwards to\nAustralia, and is now doing well at a tavern\nin Melbourne. O’Baldwin was murdered by |\nhis partner in the liquor business in New\nYork some years ago.\n\nSubsequently the Ciark-Chambers light\n\nweight Hattle, the Allen-Goss fight,which tae\nformer eould never have won\nunder any circum-tances, being\nrobbed out of the battle. and\nthe Dwyer-Elliot fight, which led directly\nto the battle of yesterday, were the events\nwhich are fresh in public remembrance.\nBULLIVAN’S VICTORY.\nFey CE BRT\ni PP » n\nbeyond Bav 3t.

They e¢lub to-\n| ether and get Lim a rosewood box, and a hearse\ni with four white hosses, and wear mourning bad- |.\nges, and have a bloomin’ big wake and bury him\nwith honor. Why, it makes me tired to think on |\nit. This thing is what is called by the tony chaps !.\na new hero in pugilism; well 1 guess so too, but it |\nain't no good. All these knocking out rackets is |\nfakes. Wilt I have su’'thin’? Well, I will, but\n| ti.is yer rum has brought many\nA GOOD MAN\nto his end, but. as I was saying, it won’t spile any |\nmore, for the days of good ring fighters are gone.\nOh, vou want to know something about these ||\nknockin’-ount matches, eh? Well, I'll tell you, :\nbut 1t's hardly fair, though I guess it's time the\npublie quit eivin® up a dollar to see a couple of |\nfellers puttin’ up their dukes for no more than '\n1 twelve minutes. This thing was started last year |\nwhen Tug Wilson came over here to havea go |\nwith Sullivan. Well, that was on the night of\nJuly 17. I think, an awful hot ‘un, too, and the\n| Garden was packed. The papers said as how | |\nthere was more'n 12.00) paspe in the place and\n| some of em had paid as much as 85 to get inside |\nand swelter while Sullivan and ‘Tug’ hammered |\n| each other. Now, the fact’is Tug was knocked\n| out, for he laid on the floor once for nearly haif a\n1 minute before the fight was given him in the end. |\n| But he was there at the end of four rounds and the | |\npair divided some £20,000. Well, yer see that is a\nbiz sum for a fighter, and Billy Madden isa\n| smart man, and 1t was him as dia all the fine\n| work of gittin’ the crowd there. Oh, he’s a\n{is Billv. Well, ver see when Sullivan seen that |\n| he lost the fight he got mad at Billy Madden be- |\n1 canse Billy had paid more attention to the sale of {\n| tickets than to him, and then there was a Kick, |\n\"land the big dufter split from his cag ok |\n| You Know, like thie opera folks do. Then Billy |\n| probably told him—yer mind as how I says ‘prob- | .\n| ably’—as how he would go to England and get a\n| bloke as would |\nKNOCK HIM OUT, |\n| and then parted as strangers—do you see? Well,\n| while Madden was in England another man got\n| it into his nut as how there was big money in the\n| bizness, and he imported Tom Allen, who oneet |\nwas pretty good, but who, lately, is good\n{ for nothing. He was heralded by the\nannouncement that he would meet\n| Sullivan in the twenty-four-foot squared circie for\n£2,500 aside, and a great many other things as\n| weren't all as true as gospel. Well, the Allen\n| fake didn’t pan out. as when his backer saw what\n| a pufly old man he had grown to be he didn’t want\n, | any part of it. Why, it’s 'n actual fact that one\n| night at the Garden, at his benefit, he wound up\n| with George Rooke, who knotKed him down twiee\nand then they had on gloves as big as pillows\n, | Well, Tom went west. Then the same feller what\nDESI as out Tom sent to the bush of Australia for\n' | a half-breed Maori, or whatever he is, and before\n| seein’ him, said he would be\n2 i BACKED FOR £2,500\nagin Sullivan. Well, Slade, who is a big enough\nfeller, arrived here with Jem Mace, and the news-\npapers made a big card of them, and tola all their\nmovements as though thev were looking for a\nfight, while, as the people who are on the inside\n, | knew, two oxem and a log-chain wouldn't\ndrag the Maori to Sullivan or\n“| Sullivan to the Maori.

    text: "; A COCKING MAIN.\n—————————\nGreat Day for the Sports at Venice\nYesterday.\n—_——\n\nNearly a Thousand People Witnessing\nCock Fights—Over Twenty Contests Be\ntween the Plucky Birds—Where was the Hu-\nmane Society?—The Post-Dispatch Ex-\nposes the Sporting Fraternity’s Mode of\nPassing the Sabbath.\n\n. “The Humane Society agents will not be\non hand to-morrow,” said a prominent sport\nto a PosT-DISPATCH reporter, who drooped\ninto Tom Allen’s saloon Saturday night,\n\n{and a good day’s sport will he hadat the\nmain, which takes place to-morrow morning\n\n* | without fail.” The cock fight-\ners of St. Louis and vicinity\n\n| have for the last two months made extensive\n\n- | preparations for a occking main on a large\n\n| scale which was to have taken place a week\n\n-1 ago from yesterday near the Orphans’ Home\n\n, | outon the St.Charles rock road,but on account\n\n| of the sickness of one of the most interested\n\n. | parties the main was postponed for a week.\n\n{ Some or the parties who had cocks in train-\ning for two weeks previous objected to the\npostponement on the ground that longer\nconfinement would injure their fighting con-\nditions, so they agreed among themselves to |\n\n1 get off a few of the contests last Sun-\nday, and for that purpose repaired\n\n| to a lane behind Bellefontaine\n\n| Cemetery. A fair crowd assembled but the\n| affair became so thoroughly advertised that\n| the Humane Society swooped down upon the\n\n“| sports just as the cock which Roger Woods\n\n| had pitted for $15 against a bird owned, and |\n\n‘1 backed by Henry Tedford, was about dying. |\n\n| The interruption was fortunate for Woods, as\n\n| Lze hurried bis bird into a sack and saved his\nstakes, his bird dying just as Holmes and |\nfive policemen appeared upon the scene and\nbrought the sport for that day to an end.\n\n“You see,” continued the sport, “a certain\n\njclass of cock-nghters in this town can\ngive a main whenever they feel like it.\n\nI'hey can advertise it for two weeks till\n\nevery one knows it, but not ome of their\n\n| gatherings were ever interrupted by the\nvigilant officers of the Humane Society.\nNow, if some of the smaller fry go out to\nhave a little sport the mounted poiice hound\nthem and the Humane Society officers fol-\nlow, as was the case last Sunday, and if the\nleast evidence is obtained a vigorous prose-\ncution follows.”\n\n“How did the police find out about last\n\nSunday’s main 2?”\n\n“Some of the privileged parties who were\nnot interested in the main gave them the tip, |\nbut they were not quite ‘fly’ enough to make |\na case. If the Humane Society allows |\nthose fellows to fight because they happen to |\nhave a little influence with ihe Mayor,\n\n1 think they ought to be ‘fired’ and the whole\nthing shown up.”\n\n“*Lliie sport is much admired among his as-\nsociates for his forensic abilities; and as he |\nwarmed up to his subject it became painfully |\nevident that the direliction of duty on the j\n\n| part of the Humane Society agents and |\n\nmounted police would be the subject of a |\n\n| masterly oratorical eifort unless the catas- |\n\ntrophe was speedily averted, and |\nwhen the flow of eloquence was checked |\nby an invitation to drink the |\nmomeniary advantage was followed up by i\nan earnest request to seek some place where\n\na social chat could be induiged in without |\nattracting general attention. When the |\nstreet was reached, the sport returned to the |\noriginal subjeet. *“The main,” he coniinued. |\n“wiil take place out on the old camping- |\ngrounds, on the St. Charles Rock road, and |\nnot less than 1,000 men will attend it.”\n\n“Who is getting up the ficht 2”\n\n“Al Jerome and a young man living in\nButchertown named Buttermore were in a\nsaloon the other night speaking about the |\nsood fignts that took place at Joe Lucas’ pit |\nlast year till the PosT-DISPATCH raided it.\nButtermere said he had the best e¢ock of his\nweight in St. Louis, and Jerome proposed to\nfind him one that could lick’ him for |\n550. Buttermore took him up, and Henyy |\nTedford suggested that good cocks ought not |\nwo fight for less than $200, and the mawch |\nwas made for that amount.” |\n\n*“Witi there be only one fight 2”?\n\n“Henry Tediord will have at least a dozen\ncocks of as good a strain as there is in St. |\nLouls, aud every one of them will be pitted |\n\n| unless his roll gives out, but as it is al- |\nways vpreiiy large that is not likely |\nto happen: then Biil Gardenbolt will take\nnot less than six cocks, every oxze of which\nwill be pitied for a round sum. George\n\n| Grassmuck 1s going, and he never went to a\nfizht without a well filled wallet, and plenty\nof birds to contest for it. Plenty\nothers will bring e¢oecks which they are\nanxious to fight, and if there are not fifty\ntights and $10,000 won or lost to-morrow it |\nwill be because the fizht was interrupted or\nthe boys changed wonderfully since last |\nyear.’ !\n\n“Will you be there?” |\n\n“Yes, and if you meet me at Tom Allen’s I\n\nwill take you out, if you want to run the risk |\n\n{ of being hung.”\n\n| “What time will the mani commence?” |\n\ni “Early in the morninz. Meet me about |\n\n| seven o’ciock and we will be on time.”\n\n| The reporter was on hand at the time |\n\n| mentioned, and had not long to wait\n\n| before his guide arrived.\n\n| THE CROWD\n\n{ was expected to meet in Butchertown before\n\n| starting for the battlefield, to stake\n\n{the final wagers on fights already |\n\n| agreed upon, and complete ail |\npreliminaries for the days amusement. Ar- |\n\n| riving ait Dutchertown, the rendezvous was |\n| easily found. At least a hundred men. |\n| on foot, in vehicles ofl ail deseriptions and\n| on horse-back were assembled, nearly all of\n\n{ whom carried suspicious locking sacks,\n\n{ which they handied very tenderiy. About\n\nhalf-vast eight the crowd became lnpatient.\n\n| and the question \"What keeps Jerry?” was |\n\nI frequently asked, but not answered. When |\n\nthe patience oi the crowd was nearly ex-\nhausted some one eried out:\n\n“HERE HE COMES!”\n\n| and a glad smile overspread the ecountenances\n\n| of nearly all as a diminutive individual with |\n\n| a last year’s straw hat_and an alpaca coat |\ndrove upin a very rickety buggy behind a |\n\nI distressingly hungry-looking horse. This |\nproved to be the cause of the delay. Al |\n\n| Jerome, or, as he is familiarly called |\n\n“Jerry.” Another disagreeable delay re- |\n\n{ suited over a dispute between “Jerry” and |\n\n{ Henry Tedford about where the main should |\n\n| take place, “Jerry” contending that it wouaid\n\n| be unsafe to fight in the county. as the Hu- |\n\n{ mane Sociely knew the main was to take\n\n| place, and, in all probability, would\n\ni be on the _ grounas and make\n\na wholesale raid. The question was\n\n| finally scttied by a vote of those present, it\n\n| being Jdecided to visit Venice, where the\n\n| sport could be carried on in perfect safety.\n\n| The sacks were hastily stowed away in the\n\nveliicles, and the erowd started for the river\n\nin different directions, to attract no attention.\n\nIt just lacked ten minutes to noon when a\n\npit was formed in the hollow below the\n“MAYOR'S SALOON,”\n\nin Venice, The pit was formed by placing\n\nsix logs in an upright position and encircling\nthem with a rope. The crowd from St.\n\nLouis had increased to nearly six hun-\n\ndred. and the spectators furnished\nhy Venice brought the asseni-\n\nblage in the neighborhood of 1,000.\n\nDelegations were in attendance from DD\n\nI1ill, Butchertown, Buttermilk Prairie, Cote\n\nBrilliante, Compton Hill, Kerry Patch, East\n\nSt. Louis, Carondelet and other cock-fight-\n\ning localities. rag, Booms whom the re-\nporter noticed were ward Rielly, He\n\nTedford, Al. Jerome,iBillsGardenbolt, Buck\n\nRielly, Pat Djllon, Mi McGuire,\n\nJule Monday, Char Brown,\n\nJerry Slattery, Harry Hi John |\n; vy, Joe Murray, J. B. . Wm. J.\n\nj vy Aetna Grassmuck, M.

The\n\nmatch was for $200, the conditions being the\nbirds to weigh five pounds seven ounces\nwhen pitted, either side having the\nprivilege to give or take two\nounces when weighed. The Butcher-\ntown bird seemed in very poor fighting\ncondition, but his backers had confidence\nand readily took even bets till the amount\non that one fight was about ten hundred\ndollars. When weighed, Jerome’s bird\nstood five pounds eight ounces, while the\n\nButchertown cock only turned the scales at\n\nfive pounds six ounces. George Grasmuck\nwas so confident that Jerome's cock would\ncome off victorious that he offered $20 to $12\ntill he alone had $300 at stake and\ncontinued to offer heavy odds till he had no\ntakers. Billy Nobies adjusted the large\nsteel spurs to the heels of Jerome's cock,\nwhile Bod Rielly performed the same office\nfor the Butchertown bird.\n\nTHE WORD “Go”\n\nwas given by Henry Tedford, and the Dblood-\n\ned birds met with terrible force. The re-\naction caused both to fall on their\nbacks, but the favorite had mot}\ntime to regain his feet before the Butcher-.\ntown bird was again at him and drove the\nsharp gaff througn his brain, ending the |\nfight in less than a minute, on which $1,000 |\nwas staked.\n\nTHE SECOND FIGHT\n\nwas between a cock owned and pitted by |\n\nHenry Tedford, and a bird owned by Jerry |.\n\nSlattery. The tight was for $25 a side, the\n\nbirds Soins a dead match, both weighing |\nfive pounds, four ounces. Al Jerome,\n\nBill Gardenbolt and George Grassmuek |\n\n| tried to pull even from the first fight on this |\ncontest, and backed Tedford’s cock for all |\n| they could get. The fight was the hardest |\nfought of the whole day, the birds meeting |\n\nover twenty times before Sinipoly auch sue-\ncubed, having fought five minu¥es after |\nboth eyes were knocked out. About $300 |\nchanged hands on the battle.\nTHE NEXT FIGHT\n\nwas between Frank Sible and Bill Nobles,\n\nbut was devoid of interest, Noble's bird\nbeing killed in the first fly.\n\nTHE FOURTH MEETING\n\nwas looked forward to with much interest,as |\n\nJerome was offering odds of two to one that\n\nhis Dominic would kill his opponent from\n\nDry Hill The odds were freely taken |!\n\nand considerable money was staked. |\n\nJerome’s Dominic was a beautiful\n\nbird to look upon, but many learned to their |\nsorrow histlooks were deceptive, for Jerome\nhad scarcely shoved him towards his oppo- |!\nnent, when he gave vent to an unnatural ||\nscreech and flew high over the heads of the\ncrowd, running for all he was worth till\n\n| Jerowe nnally captured him and forfeited |\n\n| the fight by wringing the neck\n\noft his cock. A general scufile |\n| among those who had money staked almost |\nensued, but the Venice constables and offi- |\ncers,who were on the grounds in force, inter-\nfered, and Henry Tediord, who was holding\nmost of the bets, turned the money over to\nthe backers of the Dry Hill bird. Several |,\nother cocks of the same strain as |,\n\nJerome's Dominic were on the |.\n\ngrounds, and a wholesale wringing |1\nof necks ensued, two dozen cocks being |!\nkilled on account of the cowardice of one.\nBILL. NOBLES ~ \\\nnext pitted a 4 1b. 13 oz. cock against a bird\nof nearly the same weight belonging to Matt\n\nBrown, the iight being for £50 a side. Bet-\n\nting on this fight was very brisk, neither\nside offering odds. The birds were both game\nto the last and fought all around the pit,\n\nBrown's bird, during an unfortunate fiy, re- |,\n\nceiving its opponent's gaff through the left i\n\nleg breaking it close to tie body. The gamey|\nbird, although unable to stand, fought brave-\nly onits side and suceessiunuy repelied the | :\nsavage attacks oi its opponent. The |\ncrowd became very boisterous, and\n\ncries of “separate them” and | 1\n\n“jet them fight” were raised on all sides, |:\n\nBrown was willing to forfeit the fight in | |\n\npreference to seeing his helpless bird killed\nwithout any show of winuing, but several, |]\nwho had money staked on the issue, objected,\nand the plucky little coek was finally Killed, |-\nhis oppoient expiring a few minutes aiter\nwinning the battle. |\nTHE NEXT HALF DOZEN CONTESTS ¥\nwere uninieresiing, neiliter lasting over a |\nfew minutes, and neither being over $29 a |\nside. It was then decided, it being neariy |\n| six o'clock, to adjourn to tne “Mayor's Sa- |\nloon” to partake of a turkey luuch whieh |\n\nthe proprietor had prepared for 3:\n\nthe sports. The pit was again |\nvisited, and the Sport contin- :\nued (il darkness compelicd a cessation. |\n\nMest of the erowd started for home, but sev- :\n\neral accepted the invitation of one of the |\nconsiables to continue the sport in his large | |\nbarn, which was well-lighted and beantiiully |\n\ny adapted to cock-fighting. How late last |\n\n) night the sport continued is not known, |\n\ni but when the reporier left at seven o'eloek |\n\n| at least two more dozen fizhts were arranged, |\n\n| Venice is a veritable paradise for cack fizhi-\ners, and must necessatily beeoqie a favorite |\n\n| resort of this elass of ihe short-haired fra- |\n\n| ternity, as the anthorities have no objection |\n\n| to this sort of amusement. i\n\nYesterday's main was the largest and most\n\nexciting held in the vieinity of St. Louis for |\n\n| several years, lasting aecariy tweive hours,\nover two irundred blooded birds taking part |\n| and over $10,000 changing hands. |",

At 1 o'clock this\nmorning Frank Rush was shot in front of Tom\nAllen's saloon at 621 Market street by an unknown\nman, who made his escape after a very deger-\nmined attempt to murder his man. The statements\nof the various parties failed to agree in important\ndetails, which are not matters of hurried im-\npression but questions of fact concerning which\nthere is no good reason for irreconcilable stories.\nFree and easy concerts are given me at Allen's\nplace. Each person in attendance is called upon to\nadd to the entertainment, which is filled out by\nregulars when the time lags. Among those\nattaches of the place 1s Frank Rush, a coal miner,\nwho lodges over the saloon. Recently, according\nto the proprietors statement, Rush has been labor-\ning about the city, spending his evenings at the\nsaloon. Last night the crowd had dwindled down,\n\n; when a stranger, who is described as5 feet 10\ninches high, dark complexion, slim buiit, smooth\n\nface, wearing a long. dirty grey overcoat,\nlow 5 pic shoes and about 25 years old,\nentered the place. The statements of the subse-\nquent occurrence, which may possibly result in a\nmurder, are as follows: Tum Allen, the proprie-\ntor, said: “I was playing cards in the concert-\nroom when this fellow came in. He said he was\nhere from Chicago on a spree and asked for a wom-\nan on Eighth street. He was so drunk he couldn't\nlight his cigar and Rush hit him a tip. He staggered\nout after falling against the es\ntition and then he fell vg the window.\nChrist Hoff, tue bartender, told Rush to go out ana\nsee that the fellow didn’t tumble in through the |\nwindow. It wasn't half a minute before we neard\nthe shots as fast as a man could fire a gun, When\nwe got outside the man was gone.\n\nRush's first statement was as follows: “I gave\nhim a light and he staggered out against\nthe door. I went out after him to brace him up. {|\nHe fe.l against the window. I grabbed him by the\nshoulder and said: ‘Logx out, old man, you'll break\nthe window.” He said: ‘Let go, d—m you,” and\npuiled out a revolver gnd began shooting. I said:\n‘Don’t shoot, I won't hurt you,” and he said: ‘I\n\n{ guess you won't.”\n\nThose who saw the man run dway say he was not\ndrunk but ran rapidly. At the saloon even all\n\n{ parties admit that possibly the man thought he was\n\nbeing robbed, a theory gi 4 shared by the\n\n| officers. Rush had one il extracted from his\n| shoulder. The second is lodged in the chest. Two\nof tue shots evidently missed the mark.\n\nFrank Rush, the wounded man, is now resting\neasy at his room over Allen's saloon. He denies\nthat he knew the man, but on reconsidering tle\nshooting, he said that\n\nIT SEEMED LESS MYSTERIOUS\n\nthan it did last night, as he did not believe the man\nwas really as drunk as he appeared to be.\nA crowd including Tom Allen, a young ||\nfellow named Spelker<and the bartender assembled\naround Rush's bed this morning and on an inter-\nchange of opinion they came to the conclusion that\nthe shooting was premeditated. On entering the\nsaloon last night the man said he was from Chicago\nand had come to this city to en-\njoy a spree. He was then. apparentiy\ndrunk, but a few minutes later sharpened a lead\npencil, putting a fine point on without once break-\ning it. This was overlooked at the time, but, in the\nlight of the new tueory, it 1s taken as a strong evi-\ndence that the man was disseinbling. He then walsked\nback to the rear of the concert rpom, in which Alien\nand a young man were playing “sven up.” On\nhis return be bought a cigar, which he put in his\npocket, relighting a stump which he had in his\nmouth. He stagzered against Rush and apparently\nonly gained the door by chance. All are agreed\nthat a very short time elapsed between the exit of\nRush, who went to see that the window was not\nbroken, and the shots. The manner in which he\nmade his escape confirms the theory that he was\nnot as drunk as he appeared to be\n\nThe statement made by ome of the habitues of the\nChampion's Rest was that the stranger resembled a\nman who was roughly handled and ejected\nfrom the place some time ago.\n\nTHE BARTENDER\nwas of the impression that he had seen the man be-\nfore in this city. The story of the previous trouble\ncould not be traced, but seems a very reasonable\nexplanation of the shooting. Rush admits that he\ntook hold of the man, ana It is possible |\nthat the revengeful stranger also believed\nthat he was being assaulted and robbed.\nRush's wound in the chest 1s not as serious as was\nsupposed. Dr. Nidelet, who made a casual exam-\nination at noon to-day, said he rr think any of\n| the vitals had been struck by the bafl.",

Joe issued a challenge to Tom | ¢\nto contend for the honors of the position and a\nstake of $2500 a side, and, as Allen was perfectly\nwilling to again face him, he promptly accepted | ;\nand a match was speedily made. They fought | «\nSeptember 7, 1570, on Kentucky soil, the ring being ]\nfirst pitched in Kenton County, and subsequentiy,\nowing to magisterial interference, it was erected in |\nBoone County. They fought twenty-one rounds in | ¢\nall. in forty-eignt minutes, when a decision was\ngiven in Goss” favor. on account of a foul.

Goss was arrested in New |\nYork City, March 7, 1877, upon a requisition :\nfrom the Governor of Kentucky, charg:ng |\nhim with violating the State law. He was 1\ntaken to Burlington, Xy., tried, convicted,\nand, on March 18, was sentenced to six\nmonths’ imprisonments and to pay a fine |\nof 250, He was committed to jail,\nfrom which he was released July 27 upon paying a |\nportion of the fine imposed, the payment of the re- | i\nmainder being guaranteed o 4 friends.

Looking at a pugilist, in those days\nwhen he really used to fight, as he came up smiling\nin the thirtieth round, after an hour or two of hard .\nfighting, and ready for an indefinite continuance of | ;\nthe supplying and receiving of punishment, one | f\nwould almost think that so little and powerfula | ©\npiece of physical machinery could never wear out: -\nbut the taps of time, day after day, tell upon prize-\nfighters as well as the less generously endowed\nindividual, and an invincible tendency to embon-\npoint, a dullness of the vision and a stiffness of the\njoints are the warnings which nature supplies him\nto abandon a sphere of usefulness for which he is\nno ionger fitted. Of course these warnings ars\ngenerally disregarded. It is as difficult to persuade\na pugilist that he has become ‘‘stale™ as it is to\nconvince a veteran prima donna that her voice is\nlosing its charm, and it is not generally until he\nhas been made a spectacle of by soms coming\nchampion that he resigns himself to fate and retires | -\nto spend his days as the presiding genius\nof a place of public entertainment.

One of\nthese is presided over by Tom Allen, a representa-\ntive of the English school of pugilism, who came over\nhere years ago, fought his way to pre-eminent\nCis-Atlantic fame, and finally settled down in St.\nLouis as the proprietor of a “free and easy.” pat-\nterned after those in vogue in England, To this\npace the PosT-DISPATCH special artist paid a visit\nvesterday evening.

He |!\nhad been drinking and had entered upon the gar- t\nrulous stage of intoxication and was, consequently, |!\na trifle tiresome. Unlike the rest of tue company, | |\nwho discussed different heroes of the pastin turn, |!\nhe was determined to convert the proprietor | I\nand the others to his belief that, present company\nexcepted, there kad never been a prize-fighter like\nTom Paddock. At last the more modern Tom gave\nhim a conversational righthander which *‘sent him\nto sleep™ for the rest of the evening. ]\n“Shay, Tom, ole f'ler,”” he asked for the twen-\ntieth time, “now, shay, wash ever a man could\ndown Tom Paddock?”\n“Yes, sir, and there's a man can down John Sulli- | ¢\nvan, or you or any of them.” 1\n“Where'sh the man, Tom?

Presided over |\nby a pugilist and surrounded by admirers of the\nfistic art, their proceedings ars marked by a quiet\nwhich would do credit to a much more respectable\nRSORSE: There is a flavor of sentimentality in the\n| musical part of the entertainment, too, which is ;\n{| surprising.\n| 5 |\nLil rs i he]\nGide ay\n2 {« ]\n| -- (RTH\n¢ SEE oe be HE\n: or £318 !

Every\n: local sport, prominent and obscure, was on\n! hand and the even was distinguished by the\n| presence of one or two city officials and a city\nBarstoar x gig The regular programme of the\nevening was gone through, and\nat 9:45 the stage was prepared for\n| the pugilists. After some discussion\n{ Mr. Dick Roche was fixed upon as referee.\n| Mr. Al. Spink was chosen time-kceper. Pat\n| Killen and Oscar Floto seconded Burke, and |\n{ Tom ell and Tom Allen acted as seconds for\n{ Kelly. The final upshot of the affair was the\n| decision by Mr. Roche that Burke had failed to\n| Knock out Kelly in four rounds, such being the\n| proposition, and consequently, that he must\n| forfeit the $100 he had staked on his ability to\n{ do it. Burke will pay the money to-day.\nIt was past 10 o'clock when the | ris prov\nstepped upon the stage and shook hands be-\nfore starting in to work on the first\nround. They were | phonies enthusiastically.\nThe men then went at each other, sparred for\na few moments and Burke finding an opening\nlanted a terrible blow on Kelly's neck which\nPandea him on his back. He was up again but\nwas downed a second time by Burke's left, the\nround finishing with a fall-down on the part of\nKelly. The second round saw the St, Louis\nboy hammered about generally, the English\nChampion downing him three times in rapid\nsucecession.In the third round Kelly came to the\nscratch still plucky, but a little frayed at the\nedges. In this round Burke brouzht the\nblood from Kelly's nose and mouth with some\nheavy right-handers, laying him at every blow.\nHe was knocken down twice and fell once\nwithout being touched.\nBURKE CLAIMED A FOUL\nand the referee warned Kelly that if this oc-\ncurred the second time he would declare for\nBurke. In the fourth round Kelly was still in\nthe ring though ready to fail from the mere\nwind of Burke's fist. In this round Burke\nhugged him to preyenthim falling. Kelly was\nbadly battered and fell from the slightest blow\nfrom Burke and took whatever advantage he\ncould of the ten seconds allowed him to re-\nmain on the ground when he fell. These tac-\ntics rattled Burke considerably and when time\nwas up he stepped to the front and said:\n\n. ‘Gentlemen, how can I knock aman out when\nhe is on the ground all the time? Our agree-\nment was to fight with two-ounce gloves, while\nthe fight has been with four-ounce gloves. 1\ncan’t knock a man out with pillows.”\n\nAt this juncture Mr. Roche approached the\nfootlights and declared the night a draw.\nSome hot words were had all\naround and the curtain dropped,\nwhile the crowd dispersed with\nexpressions of disgust at the evening's work.\nAfter the curtain had fallen Mr. Roche’s atten-\ntion was called to the fact that his decision\nwas erroneous, as a draw could not be decided\nin the premises. Burke had either failed to\nEnock out Kelly or he had not: therefore,\nthere could have been no draw. On this ex-\nplanation Mr. Roche withdrew his former de-\ncision and merely announced, privately, the\nfact that Burke had failed to knock out Kelly\nin four rounds.\n\n‘‘“That whole business last night was ‘Tug’\nWilson and Sullivan over again,’’ said Oscar\nFloto, Burke's manager, this morning,\nto a POST-DISPATCH reporter at the\nLaclede Hotel. “I could stay with\nBurke four rounds myself like any did.\nThe first time he went down and stayed his ten\nseconds out, I knew the whole thing was fixed\nand I suid to myself that if Jack didn't get\nhis right hand in then on Kelly's\nneck, the thing could £0 on all\nnight. That's what we wanted, and\nif Jack ever got that right-hander of his in,\nKelly would won been knocked cold. How\ncould he do it though when Kelly kept run-\nning around as though he was ina walking\nmatch instead of a fist match, Burke's opinion\nof the thing was expressed in a telegram he\nsent to Davies last night, in which he merely |\nsaid: ‘It was Tug Wilson and Sullivan.\nPshaw; Kelly ought to be able to stand up |\nnineteen rounds like he did last night without\nphasing him.””’\n\nKELLY'S FRIENDS\nfeel generally jubilant over what they claim a\nvictory. Tom took his son home and fixed\nhim up in good condition. Beyond a scratch\non his arm, which he received in a fall against\nthe flies, and a little blood from his nose, Ed is\nall right.\n\n‘‘There was nojnecessity fora decision'at all’’\nsaid Tom to-day. ‘‘It wasn't a fight at all.\nThe understanding was that Ed was to stand\nup four rounds, and he did it; that settled it.’’\n\nThe contest was according to Marquis of\nQueensberry rules. During the four rounds\nwhich were fought Kelly was knocked down\nnineteen distinct times and fell down twice.\nCalculating on the ten seconds given to re-\nmain down, and he stayed it out every time,\nthis would give him 210 seconds rest\non the fioor, or a little over one\nfull round. The on the whole was\na dy. 4 funny affair. Young Kelly\nwas backed up by his father and Tom Allen,\nwho did everything to encourage him and push\nhim to the front, and the yells of SRefiv\n‘“‘Kelly!”’ ‘“Give it to him, Ed!\"\nand a score of such marks of\napprobation from the audience man-\naged to hold Ed up considerably. After the\ncontest was over, Burke claimed that the\nagreement was to fight with two-ounce gloves,\nThe fact of the matter was, that there was a\nsplit on the gloves, Burke insisting on usin\ntwo-ounce and ow on four and\nthree-quarter-ounce gloves. A compro-\nmise was then effected on four-ounce\nweapons, it being clearly understood that soft\nand not hard gloves were to be used. Many in\nthe audience held rather strong opinions as to\nthe affair, one gentleman, weit versed in ring\nrules, holding that the decision should have\nbeen rendered in Burke's favor because of the\nfoul in Sellye falling without being touched,\nthe Queensberry rule on this point Setng that\na foul loses the fight. It was thought further,\nthat Mr. Roche erred in “*warning’’ Mr. Kelly\nas the simple fact that he had fouled gave the\nfight to his opponent.\n\n. SE JACK BURKE\n\nas no particular regret that youn Kell\nom with him the four rounds, beyond what\nlittle irritation he might naturally feel. The\nfact will not derogate, in the slightest, from\nhis reputation as a pugilist as it was altogether\na negative contest. ad Kelly stood up to the\nscratch and endeavored to Rave used his ag-\ngressive and defensive tactics at the same\ntime, which really constitutes the art of\npuetion, Burke would have paralyzed him as\n\nie did Cleary in Chicago. One good thing,\n\nat all events, will come out of it and that to\n\nKelly's benefit. He learned a lesson last\n\nnight which he will never forget and which\n\ntaught him more than he over know before.\n\nAt his next encounter he will have more con-\n| fidence and pluck.",

He had been so long in re-\ntirement from the ring and lived so humble\nand obscure a life that many thought nim dead\nfor years. The younger generation of fight-\ners and sporting men only knew of himina\nvague sort of way as a big, strong slugger\nwho had once been a sort of somebody\nfin the fistic ranks. I knew him\nwell, and saw him fight Bill Blake,\nthe Western ¢‘Dublin Tricks,”’ Joe Coburn,\nAaron Jones and Tom Allen. He was a slug-\nzer, pure and simple, and his knowledge of\nthe manly art was but rudimentary. Ie was\nas game as a pebble, though he had a way of\nflinching when he was hit hard that would lead\none to think otherwise. Dublin Tricks would\nhave whipped him with ease but for the crowd\npresent. It was largely composed of the deck\nhands and roustabouts, friends of McCool,\nand they made no bones of their intent to kill\nBlake if he won. Small wonder that he lost,\nas he did, purposely.\n\n»* b\n\nThat Mike was a brave and thoroughly cour-\nageous man those who knew him best were\nthe quickest to attest. Uncle Dave Bidwell of\nNew Orleans told me that the morning he was\nto fight Tom Jennings he had some difficulty\nwith his backers, and they refused to get him\na boat to carry him to the fighting ground,\nwhich was on the west side of the river. This\nwas after Jennings and his party had left the\ncity. Nothing daunted Mike set out solitary\nand alone, with his fighting togs tied ina\nhandkerchief and slung over hisshoulders and\nwalked up the levee to a point oppo-\nsite where the ring was ym His calls at-\ntracted the attention of the crowd. Jennings’\nbo~zt went over and ferried him across the\nrive ‘“‘I haven't a friend with me,’’ said he,\n“Luc if anyone will second me 1'm ready to\nfight.” Two men volunteered to handle him.\nHe went into the ring and he had no diflicuilty\nin whipping Jennings, who was a much over-\nrated man. Jennings had talked freely about\nflighting lieenan, but when the Benecia Boy\nreached New Orleans he would not pat up\neither to fight him or Ned Price, who was then\nin his retinue. There was talk of matching\nhim against Charley Perkins of Rochester, but\nit came to naught.\n\n» -\n\nMike's fight with Joe Coburn showed how\nsuperior skill and pluck were, when backed\nwith a fair degree of strength, to mere pluck\nand strength wlone. Prom first to last McCoole\nnever had the ghost*of a chance against his\nwily opponent, %ho gave him a terrible\nwhipping. Ader the fight some of the gang\nwanted to abuse the poor beaten man, but\n\n'\" *‘Red’’ Leary took his part and would not per-\nmit them to touch him. Mike lay groaning\nand moaning with pain and refused to\nbe dressed. ‘Get up,’’ said Australian\nKelly, his second, trying to frighten him into\nactivity; *‘the police are coming.’’ ‘“I don’t\ncare,’ was Mike's piteous reply, ‘‘I can\nneither sit, stand nor walk. Let me lie here\nand die.’’ He didn’t die, but got well, and\nwas afterwards so sure that ie could whip his\nconqueror that he made a fresh match to fight\nhim. This came to nothing, owing to Coburn\nhaving been amicably arrested by a United\nStates Treasury detective.\n\n> * hd\n\nPrevious to this Mike had met and defeated\nold Aaron Jones. The great opponent of Tom\nSayers was but a ghost of his former self when\nhe met McCoole, and only once in the battle\n\n» did he fight with anything like his old time\n“=#rra. That was about the middle of the con-\n‘test when he let go suddenly with his left and |\nlanded on McCoole’'s right eyebrow, cutting it |\nas though it was done with a razor and letting |\nthe eyelid drop down like Ben Butler's. The |\nblcod flowed so freely that Mike could hardly |\n\n25” out of the eye. ad Aaron put\n©’ the other shutter in the same\nmanner the fight would have been\nhis beyond a peradventure. He did\nnot and MeCoole beat him so terribly that he\nnever perfectiy recovered, as he often after-\nward said. The finishing blow was a fearful\none. It was a right-hander on the forehead\nand it floored Jones like ashot. Tt did not\nknock him insensible, however, but he flop-\n= around on the ground like a chicken with\nts neck wrung. That afternoon Jimmy El-\nliot, who had arrived in Cincinnati too late to\nsee the battle,met McCoole in the then famous\nSt. Lawrenee saloon, and said to him: ““Youn\ncall yourself the champion of America. Why,\nyou haven't whipped me yet.’”” *‘‘No, and I'll\nnot fight with you, either,’’ answered Mike.\n“I'll not fight with a thief.””\n> ? =\n\nTom Allen made a chopping block of MeCoole\non two occasions. The first time the enemies\nof Allen broke into the ring and robbed him of\nthe ght. The next time Mike was beaten so\nbadly that Tom Kelly gave in for him at the\nend of fwenty minuates. He had no brsiness\nwith men of Allen's grade. He had a fondness\nfor the ‘‘river’’ that nothing could conquer,\nana he liked his boating associates above all\nothers. In the zenith of his fistic career, the\nchampion of America, when in Louis-\nville, he invariably stopped in a low\ndoggery on the levee in preference to\ngoing to a first-class hotel. His reason was\nthat the proprietor of the place had been his\nfriend in his humbler days and headded, *“1’l1l\nnot go back on him now.’' He was unfort-\nunate in his marriage. ilis wife was a girl of\nsome education and intelligence and was the\ndaughter of a rich contractor of your city. 5%\n‘will not attempt to write of his 8t. Louis life\nfor you all know much more of it than 1 do.\nThe last time 1 saw Mike was the night be-\npre the Sullivan and Ryan fight at\nXississippi City. I found him in a saloon near\nwaniead of Cana! streetin New Orleans. I had\nrer Ket for him and I wanted him to go and\n\nthe fight but he declined, saying: ‘‘Damn\nth fighters, they are no good. If I had my\npay I'd a every one of them in the cala-\nose. hy don’t they do as I do, go to\n\n- ~work.’’ Mike was then the boss of a cotton\npens gang and he looked gray and grizzled\nar beyond his years.\n\n-\n* *\n\nThere is one thing that must be said for\nFrank Hearld and that is that he is undaunted\nby defeat.

There are two\nradically different versions of the affair. The\nDaly party, however, tell the more connected\nstory of the battle, which was a free-and gen-\neral fight between Dan Daly and Tom Allen on\nthe oneside.and Charley Daly, Dan’s brother\nand ““Dutchyv,’”’” or Frank Neal, and Steve |\nHearne, two local light weights and friends of\nMillen on-the other.\nACCORDING TO DAN’S STORY,\n“which.is borne out by the eye witnesses to the\nmffair, the middle weight champion of Mis-\nsouri was sitting peaceably at the front door\nof his place of business on Seventh street\n‘when he noticed three men turn the corner of\nMarket and run north. They were followed\nby Allen, ‘“Dutchy,’’ Hearne, and another\nmen who carried a base ball bat. When Allen\narrived at Daly’s door he stopped, and, ac-\ncording to Dan, at once began to pour forth.a\n‘volume of language, the gist of which was to\n‘seriously reflect on the parentage of\n‘everybody in the Immediate neighbor-\nhood paying particeiar attention to\nthe Daly brothers and those who followed\ntheir fortunes. At this Dan protested and\ntried to argue Allen out of his apparent be-\nlief that the fugitiveswho had just passed\nwere friends of his. Whereat Allen became\nriled and struck at Charley who, meanwhile,\nna¥ joined the group. The fighters then di-\nvided, Charley looking after ‘‘Dutehy’’ and\nHearne and Dan confining his atten-\ntion to the ex-heavyweight champion.\nBut if any one fancies that these events trans-\ngen in a gulet and orderly manner, he would\n\ne wofully wrong. Quite the reverse. They\nwere accompanied by an uninterrupted ex-\nchange of compliments in which everybody\nindulged and which threw serious doubts upon\nthe ancestry of i ep in the crowd and\nnot a few who were absent. Some of the\nepithets applied were of that peculiarly unique\ndescription which baflles ordinary language\nto express and which defy pariphrase, Suflice\nit to say that all the Billingsgate at hand and\nin mind was called upon to express there\nspectives attitudes of the fighters toward one\nanother. Allen, it would appear, squared off\nand was ““downed’’ by Daly, while ‘*Dutchy’”’\nand Hearne were punished by Charley. To\nput it in the words of an eye-witness who de-\nscribed it this morning, “‘it was a caution to\nsee Dutchy and Hearne carry the mail when\nCharley lit onto’em.\"’\n\nHOW IT OCCURRED.\n\n“*Now if you listen,’’ sald Dan to-day, “‘I'll\ntell you how the thing occurred. You seel\nwas orang before my door when suddenly I\nsee three fellows doing a sort of peek-a-boo\nact around the cigar sign at the corner. Pretty\nsoon they started down our way, and as they\npassed us one of \"em said: ‘I ain’t going to let\nany —— —— —— —— do me up.’ Just then\ndown came Allen, with Dutchy and Hearne,\nand they stopped when they got up\nwith nus. Then Allen gaid: ‘Them’s\nthé -— — Daly, —, the — —.'\nnow you see I didn’t like that kind of talk and\nI went up to Allen and said: ‘See here, Tom,\nthat aln’t by oY, you know.’ Charley then\ncome out and Allen said: ‘Why — —— you.\nI got two Dutchmen here that can lick any\n~——\" ** (the rest of the sentence is Inexpres-\nsible). “*With that Charley a up and said\nhe could lick both of em and then Allen let\ngo at Charley. Charley then told me to look !\nafter Allen and he'd take care of Dutchy and\nHearne and he did it, Well, Tom’ at\nup his hands and said, 8h 1\nwhat a nap 3 I've got. This ‘ers\nfellow thinks 'e’'s a fighter!” Well, I gave\nhim one in the stomach and he put down his\nhands to protect himself. Then I sald, ‘Tom,\nlook out for your stomach!” and smashed him\nin the jaw. He fell likea rv Ky on squealed\nfor mercy like a stuck pig. After he was down\nI hit him a couple of punches in the face, and\n= him Jay there until the Sergeant picked\n\nm up.”’\n\n‘“Yes,'’ sald Bob Farrell, ‘“he be ged for\nmercy when he was down. ‘For God s sake\nDan, quit, quit, quit!” That's what he said.’’\n\n\\ Meanwhile Charley pursued the other two\n/ Allen adherents. -*‘Dutchy’’ got AWAY Suc-\ncessfully, bat Hearne showed a black eye this\nmorning as the result of the fight, Theé num-\nber of blows which Daly gave the big ex-\nchampion varies according to the different\nstories. One man says that Dan hit him three\ntimes in the abdomen and SPO Studs in the\nface, and another that four blows were ad-\nministered on the abdomen and three on the\n| face. They all agree, however, that Allen\n| was knocked out and asked Daly to qu't,\n“I've quit fighting,’’ added Dan, when he\n! had finished his story, “but if Allen wants to\n+ fightI’ll fight him every day In the week for\n| fun. °° Thad been living when he was young\n| there never would have been an ex-champion\n| named Allen.’’\nTHE ALLEN VERSION.\nThe ex-champion himself was found at his\n. ‘‘free-and-easy’’ on Market street. Beyond\n~~ an abrasion on the left jaw, another on the\nright ear and a slightly black eye he did not\n! show much effect of the punishment.\n{ “*Why,\"' sald he, ‘*that was the funniest\n| thing you ever saw. You sce I was standing\n| on the corner of Seventh street and Daly\ni came up to me and began to talk about\n+ fightin’. Bome words was passed, when some-\n{body hit me in the back, and then I squared\n. off. Daly says he gy me, did he?

    text: "THE DALY-ALLEN FIGHT. I\nJudge Cady Hears Both Sides and Distributes |\nthe Fines Evenly.\n\nThe impromptu mill which took place early | 1\nSunday morning between the Allen and Daly | e=\nprize-fighters was aired before Judge Cady\nthis morning, Tom Allen, Charley Daly and\nJohn Ryan being up on counter charges of\ndisturbing the peace. Not much light was ¥\nthrown on the affair, both sides testifying\ndiametrically opposed. The Daly faction had\nthe preponderance of testimony,and their wit- | ¢;\nnesses told a more connected story and o\ncorroborated each other better than did | ©\nAllen’s witnesses, who were woefully defect- | 8\nive in their statements as $0 how the trouble | S\norigninated. The Daly story was to the effect .\nthat three man ran down Seventh street, par-\nsued by Tom Allen, John Eyan, *‘‘Dutchy’’ | &\nNeal and Steve Hearne. Allen came up and | g\nabused Dan Daly, who was sitting on the steps t]\nin front of his place. He called Daly vile .\nnames and pronounced him and his — gang\nof Irish prize fighters no good. Dan remon- i\nstrated with him and Charley came out to 2\npacify the ex-champion of the world. When | &\nhe did Allen remarked, “Hi ‘ave two | ©\nDutchmen ‘ere hand  heither one |\nhov em can lick vou.\"’ Charley\nreplied that he could lick them both, where- | ¥\nupon Allen struck him. Then Charley told | ©\nDan to take care of the ex-champion of the\nworld and he would attend to the other two. -\nCharley testified that he started for Allen’s\ntwo ‘‘Dutchmen,’’” Neal and Hearne, but -\nhad to run them two blocks to get a punch at C\nthem. When he came back Dan had 1\nknocked down Allen and the latter had eried ¢\nenough. Charley got Dan to let Allen up. | ;\n— Allen, an employe of the Dalys, testi- 1\nfied that when Charley told Dan to attend to 2\nAllen the latter said: ‘*He’'d ’ave a bloody °\npuddin’ in you.’’ Dan sailed in and knocked 0\nAllen off his pins, while In the language of | ;\nHarry Allen, Charley made the other two e\nsneak, running one as far as Tom Kelly's, | |\nwhile the other ran into Allen’s place. t\n\nJohn Ryan, a young Englishman who was t\nwith Allen, gave Lis testimony in a very funny I\nmanner, fie showed a disposition to wrestle a\nwith words which were too large for him and r\nthrew him. In a most graphic mwanner he de- t\nscrii. 4d how he and Allen fought a whole army |\nof Daly pugilists, while Hearne and “*Dutchy”’ C\nNeal were beating a retreat. Not another §\nwitness who took the stand bad seen Ryan in | {\nthe fight, They saw him come up with Allen s\nand saw no more of him until he came up the\nstreet with a base ball bat after the fight, was 5\nall over and the police had arrived. Neither i\ndid he have a single mark after his dreadful\nbattle with the fighters. Allen had a blood-\nshot eye, a cut and discolored ear and a bruise\non the side of the face. He said the fight\nstarted at Seventh and Market streets, and I\nthat Charley Daly commenc#d it by coming up\n\n{ and telling ‘“*Dutchy’’ Neal that he could lick t\n| blu. A crowd set on *‘Dutchy,’’ who ran, ¢\nand the ex-chbampion sald Bob Farrell\n\ntripped him wuile Dan Daly and a)\nwhole crowd kicked him while he] s\nwns down. ‘““They 'ad a putty |\nlively foot-ball match wid me for awhile,” |\n\n| explained Allen. *“‘When the fight com- |,\n\n| menced Dan Daly went back hand rang \"is |\ndoor-bell hand ha crowd poured out hov that\nplace like the letting out hov a theater, hand\n\nhevery bloody one hov them 'ad a kick hat\n\n\"I me.

Clark called at\n\nthe Daly Bros’, place of business yesterday\n\nand said there that hewould so arrange it\nthat the fight would be brought off, but this is\nhardly possible. Daly is disgusted and so are\n| his friends, and it is at their instance\nthat he has given the affair up. He\nsaid this morning: *‘After I fought with\nEddie Kelly 7 awore 1 would never fight again,\nand I meant it. McManus knew this and took\nadvantage of it by biuffing and challenging\nnie in the theaters. He oplayed his bluff and\nwas called down, and he got Tom Allen mixed\nup in it, too.

When the time came forthe ||\nsecond deposit the parties were not forth- ||\ncoming, and in order to save the $250 already |\nup Allen made the second deposit.\nWhen the time arrived for the\nthird deposit the parties were still absent and\nthen Allen put that up also, and so on until\nthe entire 31,000 was deposited, and Mr. Allen\nwus face to face with the situation defined by\nthe words “‘fight or forfeit.”” If he fought he\nwould lose, or was convinced that he would\n\n1 lose, and _if he forfeited he would be\njust £1,000 poorer. These were the\nconsiderations ,which, it is said, the\n\n| well known man in the business stated, in-\n\n| duced the fat and festive Thomas to stick on\ntechnicalities and this opinion seems to be =0\nunanimous among all except Tom himself\nthat there should be some truth in it.\n\nThe man who regrets most that the fight is\noff is Mr. Charlies Augustus Woods,\nwhose science anc experience had put Daly in\nfine fettle. Charley engineered Dan through\na very long mill on one occasion and he |\nwould have keenly appreciated seeing his\nman whip the stranger from Kansas City. Be-\nsides, Charley will miss the little ‘*‘chunk of\nchink,” as he calls it, which he would have\ngot if Dan won.\n\nThe training expenses of the Daly party\namounted to about $350, but Daly says the\nwork has done him that much good.

In\nsome instances the odds are as high as 2 to 1,\nbut they are all small bets such as $10.to §5.\nWhen Paddy Ryan fought Sullivan he was in |:\nno condition for a fight, and in any condition :\nwas no man to fight Sullivan. Ihave no way |\nof judging what Kilrain can do except by his | 1\nfight with Jem Smitn. Taking it that the fight | |\nwas on the square, he must be a good one, |\nfor Smith is the acknowledged champion of\nEngland and, but for the darkness coming\non, Kilrain would have won. Mitchell fought |\nSulllvan a draw and Mitchell is not as good |\naman as Smith. That would indicate that |.\nKilrain is the better man, providing Sallivan |\nwas in condition when he met Mitchell, which\nIdo not think he was. 1 or Sullivan as a\nphenomenal fighter, and if Kiirain can whip\nnim he is certainly champion of the world.\nIt’s likely to prove a hard fight. That is the\nonly opinion I will venture.””’\nDAN DALY SAID:\n\n“+*Bullivan will win sure and win easily. 1\ntel! you the big fellow is a wonder and when he | |\nis in condition none of these fighters haveany | {\nshow with him and I think he will be in con-\ndition for this fight. I will certainly- put up\non him all the money I can raise. In my |!\nopinion Kilrain bas no chance to win. Ishall |,\nattend the fight.’’\n\nSAID CHARLEY DALY:\n\n: *“If that fight comes off Sullivan will win. | «\nIf the big feilow is in condition he will whip |\nKilraln easily, and if not in condition Sulli- |.\nvan’s backers, rather than take any chances\non losing their money, will see that the fight |\ndoes not proceed. Sullivan has greater size | |\nand strength than Kilrain,and there are none |,\nof them any more clever than the big fellow. ||\nThis talk about him merely possessing brute | ;\nstrengthjis all bosh. He is as scienced as any |\nfighter, and has a rush which none of them |\nhave. Mind you, I don’t think that he will |\nwhip Kilrain in a punch, but I think less than |\nfifteen rounds will settle the fight. One thing\nin Kilrain’s favour are his seconds, Charley |,\nMitchell and Mike Donovan. Both are very |\ncunning and know lots of points about Sulli-\nvan’s fighting which they can tip to Kilrain.’* |\n\nBOB FAHRELL, :\nthe light-weight, who traveled in Sullivan's |\nfirst combination, remarked: *‘If a man will\nstand up to Sullivan and fight there is\nnot a puglilistin the world who stands any\nchance with him. He is a wonder, and the\nonly way they can Rossinty whip him isto |\nout-general him. He isa big, impatient fel-\nlow, and they might get him to tire himself\nout just as Mitchell did with him, and then\nmight whip him, but they can never do it oth-\nerwise. However,I think that Michell fight has\nbeen a lesson to John, and that they will not\nbe able to fool him again. I certainly expect\nhim to win.”’ |\n\nPROF. BILL CLARK,\nthe Belfast Chicken, is a believer in Kiirain.\n‘‘I know both men well,”’ he remarked, and\nthe fight Kiirain made against that big Jem\nSmith stamps him as a splendid man. Salli-\nvan came out at a time when there were no\nfighters and made his reputation in glove con-\ntests of a few rounds. He is a boxer and not\na fighter. There is a vast difference between\nboxing Queensberry rules and fighting London\nPrize Ring rules. Sullivan never whipped\nany man in a flght except Paddy Ryan\nwho amounts to nothing. When he meets\nKilrain be will have the strongest opponent\nhe ever had and a man who can fight London\nrules. Sullivan has not taken care of himself\nand is a big, stubborn fellow whom no one\ncan make train, and he wili not be able to\nstay. Of course, he may get in a chance blow\nand knock out Kilrain, but otherwise I do not\nthink he will win. I shall certainly put my\n_ ~Jnoney on Kilrain. It is doubtful whether the\nfight will ever be finished, (however. They are\nvery apt to break it up at the ring. Now you\nmark what I say.’\nTOM ALLEN.\n\n*“Kilrain will win, suare,’”’ remarked Tom\nAllen. ‘‘The people generally greatly over-\nestimate Sullivan. He made reputation by\ngoing around* the country sparring and\n\nnocking people out with gloves, but has\nnever done anything in the ring except whip\nPaddy Ryan, who never could fight. This\nman Kiirain is a very clever fighter or he\ncould never have given Jem Smith the battle\nhe dia. He takes good care of himself and, I\nthink, 1s a much better man than Sullivan un-\nder London prize ring rules. My money shall\ncertainly be placed on Kilrain.’\n\nFRED WATKINS STATED:\n\n““ITam gpd co the fight with Tom Allen and\nTom Kelly, and I shall back Kilrain. I think\nhe will win because ne knows much more\nabout the London prize ring rules than Sulli-\nvan and is a better fighter under them. In\nChieago, from which place I have vy re-\nturned, I found everybody Sullivan, but that\ndoes not change my opinion one whit. Sulli-\nvan is a sparrer, and not a fighter.”’\n\nHUGH M'MANUS. |\n\n‘“‘Ithink Kilrain will win and have placed\nsome money on him,’”’ remarkea Hugh Mec-\nManus, the middle-weight. *‘‘The odds here\nare about 5 to 4 in Sullivan's favor, but the\noe in my opinion, are mistaken in their\n\nudgment of the men. Sullivan is not the\nman he used to be, and it is questionable\nwhetner he ever was the man Kilrain is. Cer-\ntain is that the big fellow has injured himself\nRe deal by his dissipation and I do not\nthink he Rae peso Kilrain’s equal. The lat-\nter is a great fighter, as his meeting with Smith\nclearly shows.’\n\nHANK WIDER.\n\n*‘It will be a walk-over for Kilrain,’'’ sald\nHank Wider. ‘‘At one time Sullivan could\nwhip any of them easily, but he can’t do it\nnow. Dissipation kas broken him down, and\n\n18 no longer fit for a fight. No man ean\nnk and carouse as Sullivan has done and\n‘n his strength and condition.

Before\nBan Francisco and New Orleans came Into\nprominence and overshadowed all the rest of\nthe Union the Mqund City could almost be\nsald to vie with New York and Boston asa\npugllistic Mecca.

But delegations\nfrom other cities were not Infrequent and\nevery big mill on the banks of the Mississippi\nwas attended by sporting men from Chicago,\nCincinnatl and New York. The most noted\nstars in the pugilistic irmament that have\nmade St. Louis their home are Tom Allen,\nwho at the time of his retirement was heavy-\nweight champion of the world; Tom Kelly, |\nthe middle-welght champion; Mike McCoole,\nat one time champion of America; Charles\nDaly, ex-light-welght champion of America.\nThe SUNDAY PoST-DISPATCH to-day presents\nits readers with pictures of these men anda\nsketch of their lives and principal battles.\n\nTOM KELLY.\n\nTom Kelly was born near the town of Cas-\ntlerea in the County of Roscommon, Ireland,\nNov. 10, 1838. In 1851, young Kelly, with his\nmother, three brothers and a sister crossed\nthe channel and settled at Dewsbury in York-\nshire, where he went to work in a woolen\nfactory. The boys about the place were fond\nof using the gloves and Tom'’s cleverness\nsoon made him ‘‘cock of the mill.”” When 19\nyears of age, 5 feet 914 Inches in height,\nthe cotton lads clubbed together\nand made up a purse to match Tom\nagainst a local champion named Johnny\nMoran. They met near Dewsbury and fought\nseventy-seven rounds In 1h. 55m. Kelly had\nthe worst of the fight for the first hour, but\nhe kept gamely on until the arrival or the\npolice put an end to the flighting. When he\nmet Moran two years after he came out with\nfying colors after a brief contest. Tem then\nadopted the custom of that time, traveling\nabout and boxing at the various races and\nfairs. Tom married about this time\nand was bent on quitting the ring,\n\nTAR D\nws §-Y\n%\nBEE Ny\nwy % | Wey\nAE Sa\n=, — \\\n=—=\n= 7 ES 2\n7 Z by\nTom Kelly.\nbut his friends wouid not have It\nthat way and put up £25 for a match be-\ntween him and Jim Connor of Leeds. They\nmet at Dewsbury Oct. 1, 1860. Tom whipped\nhis men in fifty-eight minutes. After this\nKelly joined a boxing company run by Mickey\nBent and was carded to fight any novice In\nEngland at 146 pounds. Fifteen months\nelapsed before his next battle. On Dec. 24,\n1861, the day before Christmas, known in\nEngland as boxing day, he fought Dan Lomas\nat Staleybridge. Afterseventy-sevenminutes\nfighting, with Kelly’ the favorite all through,\nLomas adopted the daropping game and\nlost the fight rn going down\nwithout being hit. A fresh match was made\nfor Feb. 4, 1863. After eluding the police all\nday the men met late in the afternoon and\nLomas lost the fight through the identical\noffense which lost him the first match, after\nforty-six rounds had been fought. On Sept.\n22, 1863, he met Bill Brown, Lamas’ old\nconqueror, for £100 a side. The men met at\nAldershot, Jem Mace seconding Kelly. The\nboy from Castlerea went at his opponent |\nhammer-and-tongs and punched him out in\nseven rounds. Tom was then matched to\nmeet Jack Rooke for £100 a\nside. The odds were largely in\nRooke’s favor and he was tempted by the\ngamblers to torow down the flight. Kelly was\nnot in on the game. The men met at Thames\nHaven Feb. 14, 1865. After six rounds had\nbeen fought, with everything in Kelly's fa-\nvor, Bob Brettle, one of Rooke’s seconds,\nbroke into the ring and struck his man, then\nafterward pulled up one of the stakes and\nbelabored him with it. Keily was awarded |\nthe stakes, but the bets were declared off. |\nKelly, to show that he had no knowledge |\nof the fight being crooked, offered to fight\nRooke the same week for £200 a side, but\nRooke declined. They met a second time on\nApril 25, 1865, and Tom was put out in the |\nthirteenth round, He then took a breath-\ning spell of seventeen months before he was\npitted against Harry Allen, a brother of\nTom's, for £50 a side. They met at Flouch\nSept. :8, 1866. The fight his terrific one,\nboth men having to be carried from the ring.\nKelly’s nose was broken and both eves\nclosed. He stood up to his antagonist for\nthirty-six rounds before he was put out. On\nMarch 5, 1867, Tom met Dick Radley at Clap-\nham Commons. Kelly had the best of it for |\neleven rounds, when the police interfered.\nThe referee ordered the fight on for the next\nday, but Richard had enough. Aiter this\nfight Kelly sold out his goods and\nchattels and salled for America, land-\ning In New York Jan. 11, 1865. He\nchallenged unsuccessfully any 150- pound man\nin the country. After traveling on a\nsparring exhibition tour Tom settled In this\ncity. Here he was backed or Lr mn local |\nfavorite, Fred Bussey, who had defeated Andy\nDuffy and ‘‘Soap’’ McAlpine. Tom Allen sec- |\nonded Bussey. 71he fight lasted twenty-seven\nrounds, and though Kelly was almost\nwhipped at the start his gameness won him\nthe fight. This was his first and last fight in |\nhis adopted country, for though he\nchallenged any middle-weight in the world\nhe met with no response. He then retired |\nfrom the ring, but has acted as second In |\nmany fights, the most notable of which was |\nthe ~ullivan-Ryan battle, when Tom was In\nthe 1rojan’s corner.\nTOM ALLEN. |\n\nTom Allen, the retired champion of the\nworld, has been for years a resident of this |\ncity. He keeps a saloon called the Cham- |\nplon’s kest, which Is quite a resort ror lovers |\nof the ighter’s art.

NcCool was\n| beaten in seven rounds. 1he following month\nhe bested Ben Hogan In three rounds. 71his\nwas perhaps the most exciting battle of his\n! career, as Hogan’s friends broke into the\nring and pointed their pistols at Allen’s\n| head. On sept. 7, 1876 he fought Joe Goss for\n$2,500 a side. 1 he fight lasted for thirty-seven\nrounds and matters were as lively outside\nthe ring as in. Allen won the fight but was\nswindled out of the money on an alleged foul.\n\nOn May 6, 1877, the champion returned to\nEngland and in November met and defeated\nTompkin Gilbert itn five rounds for £100 a\n\n| side.

After\nreturning to America he came back to St.\nLouls, where he has since remained, only\n| leaving from time to time to attend the great\npugillsitic events. A day or two after his\nreturn from Nev Orleans, where he was\nlionized by the sporting element attending\nthe big fight, he met with a painful accident.\nWhile out driving he was thrown against a\npost and 1s now seriously ill from the shock. |\nMIKE M’COOLE.\n\nMike McCoole, who was once as great an |\nidol to st.

His first\n{ appearance there was against Ed Carroll,\n\nthe *‘Hoboken Clipper,’”’ whom he bested in\n\nthree rounds, le next defeated *‘i icky\n\nCoburn for a silver cup.

He is about to open a new school of |\nboxing over Tom Kelly’s pugllistic resort.\n\nPROF. BILL CLARK.\n\nProf. Willlam Clarg, who In his younger\ndays was christened the ‘‘Belfast Chicken’’\nis 2 native of Manchester, England, where he\nwas born 67 rears ago. His father dled when\nhe was in his teens, leaving his mother with\na family of nine children to support. Box-\ning was the great athletic sport in England\nat this period and young Clark became\nenthustastic over {t. One fair week In\nManchester he paid his last 4 cents to witness\na boxing contest, which was advertised to\ntake place between a local terror and Jack\nGolden, who was known as the ‘‘Bristoi |\nBuicher.”’ The local terror, however, |\nfalled to materialize and young\nClark volunteered to take his place.\nHe made a good showing with the “*Bristol\nButcher’’ and was offered a job with the\ncombination at £1 a week, which he accepted\nand traveled with them for two months. He\nthen went to London and sparred at McLeon\n& Nowby’s puxilistic resort and was then\nmatched to ight Dan McNulty of Birmingham\nfor a £10 purse. The contest came off at the\nChester race track and Clark was successful\nin the eighth round. A week after\nthis he whipped Jemmy Trainer at the\nArmtry} race track In Liverpool In five\nrounds. A gentleman admirer named O'Nell\nthen took him up and sent him to London\nagain and asked Owen Swift to make a cham-\npion out of him. Clarkazat this time weighed\nnine stone two, and (’Neill wanted to put\nhim against any man in England at that\nwelght. Swift, however, said his hands\nwere no gond and refused to handle him.\nIn 15849 Mickey Bent of Lester hired\nhim at £5 per week to travel\nwith his combination. He went all through\nEngland, Ireland and Scotland with thls\ncombination, encountering eight or ten men\na dav of all welgnts for over a year. At the\n(zlasgow fair that year the authoriti=s\nwould not permit the show to put up a tent\nand Clark hired a hallon hls own account\nand took charge of the show. Bent then\npulied out and Clark ran the combination,\nmaking a good deal of money.\nHis profits enabled him to go into\nthe retall ilquor business In London in 1850,\nwhere he remained until 1853 when he came\nover to this country with Bob Travis. As\nsoon as he arrived in this country John Mor-\nrissey hired him to train Anstralian Ke'ly,\nwho was matched to flzht Ned Price. Clark,\nafter sizins Kelly up, refused to train him,\nPrice, in the flght that followed, pu:ichel\nthe Australian full o: holes. Clark settled in\nNew York and ran a saloon and boxing\nresort there for some time, during which\nat various times he met Morrissey, Heenan,\nCoburn, Goss, Mace, Dwyer, Cockney,\nWceods and other good ones in boxing con-\ntests. HIs best encounter was wich Joe Co-\nburn, who bested him by one point after\nthirty minutes fighting. Shortly before the\nwar he went to Califc' nia, and the night ha\nlanded in San Francisco he broke\nJohnny Walker’s nose In a sparring\ncontest In Billy Smith’s American theater.\nHe then made a tour of the California coast,\nknocking out all comers and finally settled\ndown as the boxing teacher at the Olympic\nClub in fan Franci-co. He remalned in this\nposition for three years and then drifted\nback to New York and on the night of his ar-\nrival had a go with Jem Mace. After run\nning a retail liquor store in New York for |\nsome time he retired and went 1nto the\nhotel! business down on long Island. |\nHe remained in the business for sixteen |\nyears, when he sold out with the intention !\nof going back to California. On his way out |\nhe stopped over in this city and while here |\npurchased the N atatorium and settled down. |\nHis last appeara nce in the ring was with Joe |\nCoburn, in this city, two years ago, with |\nwhom he sparred for points, for thirty min. |\nutes. Clark won, registering four times,\nwhile Coburn got in but two biows. Prof. |\nBill's genial ways have made him very popu- |\nlar with his many friends and admirers in |\nthis city. |\n\nCHARLEY DALY. i\n\nCharley Daly came over to this country |\nwith his parents at the close of the war and |\nsettled down with them, ike his brother |\nDan, in Iilinols. He accompanied Dan to st, |\nLouis in 1882 and settled down In this city, |\nwhere he has remained ever slnce. His first\ncontest in the ring was with Tom Carney. |\nCarney was an old timer while\nDaly was te A a novice, neverthe-\nless Charley won after nine hard fought\n\nPES\nW uh\nES PP\nAY\n( Vi\n4 sw J\nE 26\nSZ y | ha\n77 oR a———\nUV ae\n2 =\nps es z Hut\nCiarley Daly.\nrounds. After several minor boxing con. |\ntests he encountared Billy Zachritz, with\nwhom he fought a nineteen-round draw. He\nthen went to Chicago and stopped Fred Som-\nmers in SIX roun:'s. This performance he\nfollowed up by knocking Pete Le Brun out in\ntwo rounds at Hot Springs for a $500 purse.\nJimmy Lindsay of Omaha was his next victim,\nfalling before him after eleven hot rounds,\nand a local crack named Durkin of st,\nJoseph, Mo., went out in twelve rounds for a\n$500 purse. A] Louisvile champion named\nMurray badeal! the figiit knocked out of him\nafter ten rounds by Oharley, for which he\nreceived $300, and his big fight with Billy\nMyer, the *‘‘Streater Cvclone,’’ followed. It\ntook place Dec. 28, 1857, and was for $00 a\nside and the gate receipts. At 133 pounds\nMyer won after thirty-three desperate\nrounds. Myer has always admitted that\nDaly gave him the hardest battle\nof his 1ife, not even excepting\nhis contest with Jack McAuliffe at North\nJudson, Ind. This. of course, does not in-\nclude the recent McAuliffe-liyer contest at\nNew Orleans. Daly has not entered the ring\nsince his defeat by Myer and can hardly be\ncalled a lightwelght now. In fact he is al-\nmost too heavy for even the welter-welglit\nc.ass.\nTHE LESSER LIGHTS.\n\nIn addition to these a number of lesser\nlizhts have from tine to time taken up their\nplace of abode in this city. Back In tne 70s,\nwhen police regulations were not they are\nnow, the town was swarming with scrap- |\npers.

Accompanied by Jack\nWilkes, who has agreed to furnish the stake\nfor Johnnie in a contest with Niel, they\ncalled at this office yesterday after-\nnoon and offered to put up the entire\n$500 then and there. Before doing\nso, however, it was thought best to call on\nTom Allen, who, according to Niel, would\nback him, and find out whether Niel’s state-\nment was correct. Allen, when informed\nwhat Niel had sald, stated that ‘“*Dutch’’ ex-\naggerated matters considerably. “I told\nhim,’” sald Tom, ‘‘that I would give $50\ntowards a purse for such a contest,\nbut he certainly - had no grounds for\nputting me down as saying I would\nfurnish a $500 side bet for him. I would\nlike to see *‘‘Dutch’ and Johnnie brought\ntogether, but I am not prepared to wager\n$500 on the result.” This satisfied Wilkes\nand the Dalys, all three of whom were con-\nvinceaQ that it is impossible for Niel to gst\nbacking to the extent of $500 in this city.\n\n““If ‘Dutch’ can, however,’’ said Wilkes,\n“all he has to do is to make known the fact\nto me and a match can be readlly made. I\nam friendly to both boys, butI look upon\nthis affair as a matter of business and am\nprepared to take $600 worth of chances that\nJohnnie can put out Nlel.’’\n\n‘“Dutch,’’ when seen In reference to the\nmatter, sald; ‘I noy see that 1\nhave been placed in a very Iim-\nproper light. I was given to under-\n\n| stand that Allen would furnish a stake for\n\n| me In a contest with Johnnie Daly and start-\n\n| ed out to get one on. I can defeat the latter,\n\nhowever, and 1 will try and see If I can secure\n\n| some one elise who will furnish the stake, so\n\n| that I can get an opportunity to prove what I\nhave sald.”’",

She is about\ntwenty-two; she has a quiet face, and an air of\ngentle dignity. She wears a dark-blue dress, and\na black bonnet with a scarlet ribbon bound about\nthe crown; a silver badge at her throat confines\na collar on which are two broad red stripes.\n\nShe leads a little girl by the hand. The child\nwears a little blue gown; a broad scarlet ribbon\nabout her waist is stamped, “ Given to the Lord.”\n\n“ A Salvationist,” says some one with a sneer,\n“gelling her papers.”\n\nShe enters the door and asks the first man whom\nshe meets to buy The War Cry.\n\n“(Clear out,” he answers roughly; “I want my\nnickel for whiskey.”\n\n35\n36 OUR CHILDREN OF THE SLUMS.\n\nShe looks at him quietly, saying, “God bless -\nyou, sir,” and passes on.\n\nSome young fellows stand near, and one of them\ncries out:\n\n“Well buy your papers if you'll sing for us.”\n\nThe woman hesitates; she has visited saloons\nbefore — indeed, that is one of her regular Saturday\nnight duties in the selling of her papers,— but she\nhas never been asked to sing.\n\nThe soldier sees the opportunity, however, and\nanswers quietly:\n\n“Tl sing a hymn if you like, sir.”\n\n“Sing, ‘ Nearer, my God, to Thee,”” calls out some\none.\n\nAnd clear and sweet above the clink of glasses,\nthe click of dice, the soft thud of rapidly dealt\ncards and the whirr of talk, the hymn rises:\n\n‘Nearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee,\nFE’en though it be a cross\nThat raiseth me,\nStill all my song shall be,\nNearer, my God, to Thee,\nNearer to Thee.”\n\n“Sing us another,” calls out the first voice.\n\nThis time it is one of the Salvation Army songs,\nand this its chorus:\n\nA LITTLE SALVATIONIST. 37\n“You are drifting, drifting to your doom,\n\nBut there’s merey still for you, but there’s merey still for you.”\n\nThe little girl, frightened at first, begins to sing\nwith her mother.\n\n“Tell you what, boys,” calls out one of the young\nfellows, “ we'll all sing with her, if shell sing ¢ Hold\nthe Fort,” and they do.\n\nAnd then they crowd around, and each takes a\nWar Cry.\n\n“I don’t call any man a gentleman who looks out\nfor any change,” says one man.\n\nOne of the barkeepers hands the child a sand-\nwich. She is very hungry and sets her little\nwhite teeth quickly upon it, when she remembers\nsomething.\n\n“Thank God for a good dinner,” she says, look-\ning down. Her mother turns to go out; just then\na man speaks to her:\n\n“I should think you'd be afraid to come here\nwith your child, aren’t you?”\n\n“Oh no,” she answers simply as she goes by\nhim.\n\nShe does not speak to any one except a young\nboy who stands by the door. He sang with such\na beautiful voice and he is so young, she cannot\npass him by.\n\n38 OUR CHILDREN OF THE SLUMS.\n\n“T wish, sir,” she says, “that voice was singing\nin God’s service.”\n\nHe does not answer and they go out into the\nbitter night, a long walk before them to the cheer-\nless barracks; part of the way she will carry the\nlittle girl.\n\n“Good heavens, Jack!” says one of the young\nfellows, “what gives that woman courage enough\nto come here? She was as pale as death; I know\nshe was frightened.”\n\n“I don’t know, old fellow. She’s a good woman,\nsure. What do you say to going home?”",

Allen handled and seconded Smith\nwhen he went against Peter Jackson in Chi-\ncago. On this occasion, it will be remem-\nbered, Smith made the colored cham-\n\nfon of England anda Australla slic\n74 say the least. They posse\nsix ronnds and smith had the famous ebony-\ncolored champion puffing and blowing llkea\nsteam engine at the end of the ‘*go.”’ Peter,\n\nver, was far f being in condition to\nao himeair justice, white Smith was trained\nto perfection. Allen iIs.convinced that Smith\nRie Rea digaialQuala ety oh 5rd Ni Tr TRE\n‘could have put out the colored chnmplde\nlet at him a little i lle longer.

While the |!\nex-champion was standing in EA Cuthbert’s\nsaloon Monday afternoon, surrounded by a |\ndense throng of worshippers, Bob Farrel,\nthe old-time lightweight, edged his way up |¢\nto him and was met with a warm grasp of |\nthe hand. Bob bad traveled with [1\nSullivan in both Joe Coburn’s and |\nBilly 2adden’'s combination, and the |\nbig fellow has a warm 1egard for him. The |!\nlightweight is not walking on roses just now,\nand though he made no reference to it, John\nfound it out. He went down in his pocket,\npulled out a roll and passed it over to Bob\nwithout stoppras to count it. Bob has since\nfigured out bis stake and found it amounted i\nto aver $100.\n\nPUGILISTIC POINTERS.\n\nThe unanimous opinion of people who have been\nto the McAuliffe show at the Standard this week is\nthat one character in the afterpiece should be cut\nout The character referred to is played with such\nboid and disgusting suggestiveness, hoth of costume\nanda dialogue, that there can be no mistaking the de-\npraved type of humanity intented for porirayal. To\nopenly snggest the unnawmeabie, unnaturai crime\nfalls nothing short of a criminal action. It is an in-\nsult to the decency of the audience that should be\nresented with a storm of hisses. Your show,\nMessrs. McAuliffe and Floto, will lose node of its\nattractiveness if the character is left out.",

J., and\nMike Daly of Bangor, Me., the well-known\nlightwelights, will battle to a finish,\nfor a $3,500 purse,in the arena of the Crescent\nCity Club this evening. The contest 1s to be\nat 138 pounds, and both men are to weigh in\nat 3 o’clock this afternoon. Gibbons weighed\nJust 141 pounds Sunday, but he expected to |\nbe able to rub the extra three pounds off In\nshort order. Daly is near weight, strong and\nconfident. Gibbons will probably be the\nfavorite at the post, though it 1s even, each\nin private bets and 9 to 10 each In the pool-\nrooms. Jim Gibbons and Alex Greggains will\nsecond Austin Gibbons and Capt. Daly and\nfolly Smith or Joe Choyinskl will be behind\nMike Paiy. The latter’s reputation is based\nprincipally on a draw he made\nwith Jack McAuliffe In oj several years\nagc. Unsuccessful efforts ve been made a\nnumber of times since this affair took place\nto bring the two together again. Daly is\nsald, by those who ought to know what they\nare sy 4 about, to be a quitter, and if such\nis correct his chances of being successful this\nevening can hardly be said to be rosy. No\none doubts his cleverness, however,\nand In this respect he has the :ad-\n\nntage of Gibbons. The Paterson boy\n\n1s 5 feet 812 inches. His chest measures\nneck 15%, waist 29, biceps 12, forearm 11,\n\nha 20, reach 27 Inches. Since 14 years of\n\nhe has been boxing,and for the last three\njars be has been meeting all comeérs.

Itis\na that Gibbons flunked, but Austin denies |\n8S. £\nTOM ALLEX’S OPINION.\n\nTom Allen, the veteran ex-champlon, who\nwas behind Smith, says that the fight was\nfairly won. He had picked Smith be-\nfore the fight because he knew that the man |\nwas clever and had a great right and felt\nthat Goddard could be defeated if he was\nfought properly. There was no use in stand-\noff and exchanging blows with the giant and\nthere is no law to make a man fight Goddard\nthat way. He told Smith to get his head\ninto Goddard’s body if he could and to stick\nclose all the time. He expected that God-\ndard would whip himself in time and Smit:’s |\nright couia do the rest, Smith followed In-\nstructions and won the Re. The Smith |\nparty was jubilant and claimed that their |\nman was a pugliist of the first-class on his\nmerits. He had been neglecting himself and\nhad lost fights by going into the ring with-\nout training, but had learned a lesson and\nwould proifit by it.\n\nBAT MASTERSON’S GUN. <\n\n¢«*pid Bat Masterson win the fight?’’ was the\nsignificant query of a well-known local sport\nthis morning, as a crowd of the dead game |\ncontingent discussed the result of the God-\ndard-Smith contest. *‘‘I think,’’ went on the\nspeaker, answering his own question, *‘that |\nhe did. Just recall the dispatch that came |\nup from New Orleans last week, in which Bat\nis quoted as saying that he knew Smith hada\nyellow streak in him, but that he would take |\nthe gaff if there was anybody in his corner to\nmake him fight. Well, Bat went in his corner |\nall right Friday night, and it’s reasonable to |\n\nsuppose that some great pressure was bearing\n\non Smith to make him take the awful punch-\ning he got, for its nota bit in hisline. I'll |\nbet a ra just now that Bat and his gun |\n\nplayed star parts in that game. \"e\n\n| FIGHTERS FROM ALL CLIMES,\n\n*“This country,’’ sald George Abingdon\nBaird, Charley Mitchell's backer, when In\nthis city last week, ‘‘offers such large In-\n\n| ducements for fighters that England and Aus-\n\ntralia have become depleted of boxers. Aside\n\nfrom Mitchell, Ted Pritchard was the best\nman at his weight in the old country and I\nreally expected him to whip Hall. Jim is a\nfighter, though, and poor Ted stood little\nchance to win from him. He isa good, stiff\npuncher, deucedly clever with his head and\nhands and as shifty a man on his feet as ever\nIsaw in a ring. Of course, 1 don’t know\nmuch about Fitzsimmons ops from what\nI have read in the papers, but he’s gotto be\nmore than extraordinarily good to beat Hall.\n1 shall back Hall heavily to win the fight.”’\n\nIn speaking of a ge match between\nStanton Abbott of England and Champion\nJack McAuliffe, the ’Squire said that Ab-\nbott would be yer fooiish to look for a\nmatch, as he would not stand a ghost of a i\nshow in the ring with McAuliffe, who was\ncleverer, stronger and a better fighter in\nevery way than the Englishman.\n\nPUGILISTIC POINTERS.\n\nA week ago ‘*Denver’’ Smith’s limit was §1.50 a\nday. New he has an offerof $1,000a week to ‘‘gxo\non the stage.’’ Corbett’s company offered him $730\na week to spar against the champion.\n\n© Billy Murpby of Australia has received an offer\n_ rom the Crescent Athletic Club of New Orleans to\nfight Sol Smith of San Francisco. The purse to be\nhung up was not mentioned, but it is said that a good\ninducement will be given for the pair.

This secrecy Allen thinks neces-\nsary to protect him from the authorities of\nKentucky, which State he will pass through\np Aeghnyd to Florida.

The\nKentucky authorities have never made any\n\n_ effort to extradite him from this State, but\nnevertheless, Tom is afraid they might make\ntrouble for him, if his presence In their own\nballlwick was known.\n\nThe retired champion is an enthusiastic\nMitchell man and is confident Corbett will\nmeet his conqueror in the sturdy English-\nman. Allen claims the champlon’s battles\nwith Jackson and Sulllvan show him to be a\nvery ordinary fighter. “‘*Why,’’ sald Tom\nthe other day, ‘‘E4d Smith made a ‘bloody\nsucker’ of the big black Australian when\nthey met in Chicago, and I honestly belleve\nlittle George Dixon could have fAnished Sul-\nivan as quickly as Corbett did at New Or-\nleans. In my opinion Mitchell will want\nnothing better than for the Californian to\npursue the same tactics in the coming\nbattle as he dia against Sullivan.\nNo matter how shifty he may\nbe, Corbett will learn early in the affair that\nMitchell 18 just as clever when it comes to\navoiding wicked punches. Of course both\nwill be prepared to take plenty of punish-\nment and I know that Mitchell can stand the\n“gaff” as well as the next. I also belleve\nthat Corbett’s punches will not compare in.\nforce with what he will receive from Charley\nwhen they mix matters. Mitchell's forte\nwill be at infighting, and when they come to\nclose quarters the Californian’s stomach will\nsuffer. I1Ishall be astonished If Miichell does\nnot have everything his own way at short\nrange. When Corbett rushes, providing he\nindulges in such tactics, I expect to see\nMitchell step aside and send in the\nright, good and hard, straight from\nthe shoulder, on Jim's stomach.\nIt 1s my belief that Charley wlll not try\nto get home above Corbett’s neck, tor be can\ndo more damage below that point. I expect\nto see very little fignting in the first dozen\nrounds or so, and just who will eventually\ncut out the work is a hard question to\nanswer. Each man will wantscme line on\nthe other before he will make any ad-\nvances.”’\n\nAllen says he has secured twelve ox talls\nfrom which he will make a jelly that has a\ntendency, he claims, to harden the stomach.\nTom says he will send this preparation to\nMitchell’s trailing quarters, and the En-\nglishman will have the benefit of whatever\ngood qualities it possesses.

By Mitchell's admirers it is\npointed out that when Sullivan was re-\ngarded as invincible and before the\ngreat Boston man had suffered the ef-\nfacts of inebriety and fast living, which,\nthey say, had rendered him unfit for\nthe ring long before he met Corbett\nat New Orleans, Mitchell fought him to\na standstill at Chantilly.

Corbett recently said that he re-\ngarded an inch advantage in height\nas equal to ten pound advantage in\nwelght. Corbett attributes great im-\nportance to advantage in reach, and\nevidbntly relies strongly on the fact\nthat he possesses this advantage over\nthe Englishman. In his fight with\nSullivan he jabbed the champion in the\nface, bread-basket and short ribs at\nhis pleasure, and got away without\nreceiving a hurtful blow.

It is said\nthat the governor has been keeping\nthe wires hot all day roasting Sclicitor\nChristie of Duval county, in the mat-\nter, charging that Christie and all the\nother judicial officers of this county\nare in collusion with the Duval Ath-\nletic club and are abetting the club's\nefforts to pull off the maich and that\nthe arrests and proposed test of the\n\nlaw are not in good faith.\n\nThe governor goes further, it is said,\nand reiterates that the proposed fight\n\nSZ ;\n& | |\nCORBETT'S RIGHT,\n\nis in violation of the laws of that state\nand asserts that it shall not come off\nunless the supreme court decides that\nsuch contests are legal. The judicial\nauthorities of this country, who, it is\nsaid, the governor has attacked, re-\nfuse to either deny or affirm the cur-\nrent reports. They admit that they\nhave received telegrams from the gov-\nernor in regard to the arrest and the\nproposed test of the law, but the nature\nof the dispatches they refuse to divulge.\n\"rom other sources, however, it is\nlearned that the tenor of the telegrams\nwas such as has been described and\nthat Governor Mitchell is highly indig-\nnant at what he terms the “collusion”\nof the Duval county authorities with\nthe promoters of the fight.\n\nAt any rate this has been a rather\n“blue day\" for the sports and there is\na rather “shaky” feeling in regard to\nthe pulling off of the fight.\n\nThe situation is about as follows:\nGov. Mitchell and Attorney General\nLamar, the highest law officers of the\nstate, assert that the contest will violate\nthe laws of the state; Bowden of the\nAthletic club and his lawyers say it\nwould not.\n\nGovernor Mitchell was once on the\nsupreme bench, and it is believed that\nhe knows as much about the laws of the\nstate as the attorneys of the club. It is\nalso believed that the opinion of Attor-\nney General Lamar, that the proposed\nfight would be illegal, was prepared af-\nter a consultation with the governor\nand members of the supreme court as\nto the law in the case.\n\nIt is significant in this connection\nthat Governor Mitchell says no decis-\nion save that of the supreme court\n\nMITCHELL'S RIGHT.\n\nFRET eet (EAS Se a ——\nwill deter him from every effort to\nstop the fight. Those close to the gov-\nernor believe that this declaration\nmeans that the governor knows that\nthe supreme court will not decide In\nfavor of the legality of the contest,\n\nSeveral things have conspired to\nmake the governor very bitter in his\nopposition to the fight. One “special\n\n| dispatch” sent out from Jacksonville\n\n| has, it is said, cut him to the quick\nand hardened him in his determination\nthat no slugging match shall occur in\nFlorida. The “special” referred to sta-\nted that while the governor was at\nTampn during the holidays certain par- |\nties who favored the fight a_i to\nget him off on a camp hunt and “mel.\nlow him and jolly him\" into allowing\nthe fight to come off,\n\nA dispatch just recelved from Tampa\nsays that the governor stated this\nevening in the most positive terms\nthat “the fight will not come off in\nFlorida.” He says that he has his\nplans for preventing the fight consum-\nmated and that at the proper moment\nhe will act,\n\nThe “proper moment” is supposed to\nbe, in the governor's opinion, when\nMitchell and Corbett are about ready\nto face one another. The governor jis\nfurther quoted as saying, “I regard\nthis proposed fight as an offense\nagainst the peace and dignity of the\nstate and my determination to prevent\nit is fixed.\"\n\nMeantime Corbett and Mitchell are\nengaged in slinging billingsgate at one\nanother to the great disgust of the pub-\nlie. Corbett yesterday In an interview\ncalled Mitchell “a convict and a sneak”\nand Mitchell veplics today, applying\nsimilar choice epithets to Corbett, Ir\nthe promoters of the fight should, by\nany chance, succeed in pulling off the\ncontest despite the governor, and Core\nboett and Mitchell fight half as well with\ntheir fists as they do with their tongues\nthe spectators will be sure to receive a\ngood run for their money,",

They now say that the\nlimit as to receipts for admission, upon\nwhien the possiblities of a fight hinged until\nyesterday, has been removed, and that\nthe men will have It out If only\ntwo persons pay for tickets. This\nis a strong statement to be sure since itis\nnot entirely in accordance with all prece-\ndent in human nature for men to throw\naway calmly $25,000 or $30,000, when a few\nwords would, in a measure, save the money.\nIt is not to encourage the sport that the club\nhas taken this stand altogether. It has come\nto a fight for supremacy between Bowden\nand his friends and Gov, Mitchell, who 1s\npractically single-handed, unless the State\ntroops show more of a disposition to help\nhim out than has yet been manifested.\n\nBowden Is a rather bright person at times,\nbut for stubbornness he could give the\nchampion mule *“thirty yards in a hundred,’”\nas the saying goes. He is a fighter who, un-\nlike many other kinds of fighters, doesn’t\nknow when he’s whipped.\n\nIT IS BOWDEN VS. MITCHELL.\n\nNow, if the Governor did not happen to be\nthe same sort of a man, the struggle would\nhave been over long ago. When he says a\nthing he means it, and his friends here say\nnothing will stop him. So it’s Bowden\nagainst Mitchell to a finish, but In\nthis contest the sports do not say, *‘May\nthe best man win.’”” They want Bowden\nto win, and hope that it will not come to a\ndraw of revolvers.\n\nThe mention of Mitchell’s name to Bowden\nstirs him up as much as the casual sugges-\ntion that malaria may be contracted in Flor-\nida riles a native. Any person who has ever\nspoken of quinine in Jacksonville will at once\nunderstand how Bowden acts when discuss-\ning the Governor’s personality. He handles\nthe Chief Executive without gloves at least\nonce every twenty minutes.\n\nIf the Governor is not between his satanic\nmajesty and the deep blue sea just now, as\nhe appears to be, he may make known\nto-day, just how he proposes to knock out\nBowden etal. What the ace is which he\nmay lead at the last moment nobody knows,\nand Bowden, for one, doesn’t carea rap. The |!\nstrongest part of the whole business is |.\nthat the Governor himself ts just a trifle 1in-\nclined to be a sport in a modest way. This Is |\nno state secret, for just after the Sullivan. |\nCorbett battle his friends had a good chance |.\nto jacket him for baa judgment. The story\nthat he lost $200 on the result is sald\nto be absolutely true, therefore, he 1s |.\nnot opposed to the fight for the reasons at- |\ntributed to him by many. Not one of its\nprojectors opposed him politically. The |\nthousands of letters from reform: leagues and |\nprivate citizens which he has received, offer- |.\ning financial ald (but In every case fallure to\ncontain anything that might be tarned into\nmoney) may have had something to do with\nit, but the consensus of opinion 1s that Gov.\nMitchell said that the fight should not take\nplace here from the start,and couldn’t afford\nafterward to take water.\n\nCHANCE TO GET EVEN.\n\n#T.1¢ Mitchell is trying to get even\non us for the money he lost\non Sullivan,’’ sald ons of the directors,\n**Harry Mason will bet him $5,000 that the\nfight takes place In Florida, which will make\nLim $4,500 winner if he wins.”’ Pretty sirong\ntalk this, but the talk In the clubis at times\ndecidedly stronger.

He has never\nbeileved that Mitchell will fight, and won't |\nbe convinced until he is in the ring, and even\nwhile the gloves are being adjusted the\ntrainer thinks there is a chance for Charlie\nto twist hls arm out of joint or something of\nthat sort, Delaney still fears that his pre-\ndletion that Mitchell will poison himself one\nweek from Wednesday night and lay It at the\ndoor of one or his attendants.\n\nMITCHELL ANGRY.\n\n~ When Mitchell heard of this his British\nblood botled, and if Delaney happened to\ndrop In just about that time there would |\nhave been some excitement, even if down-\nright ighting Alan’'t occur.\n\n“*And Corbett wonders why he is A.\nlar in his own country, does he?'” Charlie ex-\nclaimed. “‘Perhaps he thinks that there ls\nno spirit of fair ploy here.

He'd have |,\nto be shoveled out,’’ added the Englishman ji,\nmaking a wicked lunge at an imagin-\nary American champion. *‘Oh, but what\na story such a meeting would\nmake!’ Mitchell talked a little further on\nthe'*‘roasting’’ question, and convinced Lis\nhearers that he isn’t an amateur at it him-\nself,\n\nWhen his attention was drawn to a pile of\nletters and telegrams, for half an hour he let\nthe American champlon rest and attended to\nthe other matter. Most of the letters were\nfrom persons who knew Just how he should\ngo about it to wallop Corbett and offered\ntheir ideas gratis.\n\nA RABBIT FOOT.\n\nSeveral were from cranks who wanted\nmoney, and nearly all were well worth read-\ning. One In particalar was interesting, and\nshould the great protector against hard luck\nbe wellfformed, Charley certainly has afroyal\nchance to stave off disaster, and it is difficult\nto see how any superstitious man intue\nworld could rest from betting on the Briton.\nThe letter read: N\n\nDEAR MITCHELL—You will find inclosed the left\nnind feot ef a buck rabbit, whieh might not of itself\npossess any particular value if it wasn’t for the ract\nthat it was £ ors at midmight on Dee, 13 by a hump-\nbacked man on the grave of a murderer, How can\nyou lose with tails?\n\nYOUR BATON ROUGE ADMIRERS.\n\n“Now, if the man happened\nto be, the burglar who tried to steal Corbett,\nI'd think the chain complete,’’ laughed\nCharlie, but Brady didm’t describe tie In-\ntruder.’’\n\n‘*Tnree hours later, after he had\nlost $6.30 at hearts at 5 cents\na point, Mitchell wrapped the foot\nup carefully in brown paper ana sent for his\ncook, whom he instructea to bary the mascot\nin the sand. Mitchell says there wlll be a\nfight In any event, and he talks like a man in\nearnest. He wants Mr. Kelly to get the\n$20,000 check cashed in time to be able to\nshow the money in the ring.\n\n**These checks with long provisional In-\ndorsements are all right,’’ he argued, “‘but\nMr. Kelly will feel better with the real article\nin his pocket and I know I shall.”’\n\n‘“There is no chance for Mitchell to\nbe lonesome, for besides Harry Dale,\nBat Masterson, Billy Thompson, Jim\nHall, Steve O'Donnell and Ww.\nH.

It’s\na mighty jolly party, but Charlie Is the life\nof it. Perhaps 200 persons crossed the river\nto look around the light-house and suar-\nrounding objects of interest, and Hall made\nhimself up for the occasion in a\nwhite duck suit and broad-brimmed straw\nhat. In spite of this, Mitchell In plain\nstriped flannels attracted more attention\nthan Aid the Australian.

The only\n\n= | person who claimed Allen’s attention was a\nPOST-DISPATCH reporter, who boarded the\n- | Inbound train at the Relay Depot in East St,\nn | Louis.

At first I thought\nthe fellow was Joking, but when\n1 saw two other fellows\ncame in behind him I thought he must be an\nofficer of the law making a gambling raid.\nHe yelled again, ‘Throw up your hands!’\nand the two men behind him rushed out and\ngrabbad the card players. 1he Iittle\nfellow who had a dark hat and\na sack coat held Spillane and\nMcMahon, who had thrown up thelr hapds\nwhile the big fellow who had a white hand-\nkerchlef tied over his mouth and nose went\nafter Carroll. He was a powerful, big man,\nbut Carroll tussied with him. The man with\nthe gun, and who had a mustache\nand wore an overcoat and a\ncap, angrily sald, ‘Get out of the\nway till I shoot; he’s the fellow I'm after,’\nreferring to Carroll by a vile name. The bi\nman threw Carroll over against the back\ndoor and the saloon-keeper threw up his\nhands. He with Spillane and Mc: ahon, who\nhad thrown up thelr hands, weretheld at bay\nby the man with the gun while the lit-\ntie fellow went through his two men\nand got un watch from each and the big fel-\nlow got into Carroll’s pocket and got $175.\nThen he went behind the counter and robbed\nthe till of some $17, but falled to see a watch\nwhich was lying on the shelf. Having se-\ncared all the booty they were after, they\nfled through the front door, the\nman with the weapon keeping\nhis pistol leveled all the time atthe card\nplayers. As he went out the door he re-\nmarked, ‘If you—you I a ag to\ncarroll—follow me out of here, I'll blow your\nbrains nut.” With this the two disappeared.\nWe were too frightened to attempt to catch\nthem and so they got away safely.”’\n\nThe man with the gun 1s supposed to be\nthe leader of the trio and to have known that\nvarroli carried a large roll of bills. Who he\nis remains a mnystery. Foley 1s accused of\nbeing the Jittie man. The man with\nthe plstoi 1s described as neing 5 feet 9 Inches\nnigh and aboal 3) years of uge, and tne big\nroonber as 5 feet 11 inches high and about 26\nyears old.\n> »_petines, Tis partes a whe\nTR TR EERE a RAR FOS EERE i Ria nl We (Ee A",

    text: "MODERN BOXERS.\n————\n- -\nThe Retired Champion Says\n-\nThey Are Not Fighters.\nONLY BUN PUGS AND POOR ACTORS. |\n—— —\n\nTom Allen, the retired champion pugilist |\nof the world, has decided views on modern |\npugilism, and the new school of fighters. |\nThe veteran frequently refers to them as |\nbad actors. and bum pugs. The following |\nletter is characteristic: |\n\nTHE ONLY CHAMPION'S REST. |\nTo the Editor of the Post-Dispatch.\n#I regard it as a duty to enlighten the |\nyoung and likewise ee the old about |\nthe prize ring. There are a i og pore of |.\nthe younger generation who do mot know |\nwhat a prize fighter is. They have never |\nseen anything but glove fighters in these |\ndays. A porate exc is a fighter who bat- |\ntles with bare knuckles in the open air and |\non the turf, regardless of hail, rain, sun- |.\nshine or snow. A boxing champion, or\nglove-fighter, is one who has feather pil- |\n=\nNE\nNo ed\n78 SEN\n: F 83\nLEE\n{ 7 -, 33\nNON L . 2m\nANR NN NAN So\nNH RR\n“NA NR NR NNN NE\nNANNY FE\nRNR NN BRN\nAR RN SAN\n{ NAN NN N lL ON RS\nN | NR SS\nTOM ALLEN,\nlows on his hands when he enters the ring,\nwhich must be in a warm, comfortable\nroom. In my time we had prize fights; now\nthere are boxing matches with top-heavy\npurses hung up.\n\nIt has been said that I am not the retired\nchampion pugilist. After my fight with Joe\nGoss in 1876 I went to Chicago\nto box a week at one of the theaters, Mike\nMcDonald told me that Jem Mace, who was\nalso in Chicago, was going to answer my\nchallenge. I told Mike I would fight Mace\nfor $10 or as much more as Jem could raise.\nI knew Mace was broke, and I did not\nwant to bluff him by naming a figure he\ncould not get. I wanted to have another\ngo at him. The upshot of it was that Mace\nand I traveled together all over the coun-\ntry. I was billed and acknowledged as the\nchampion of the world, and Mace is the\nex-champion. I am the only pugilist who\never left this country, open to fight any\nman living. On my arrival in England 1\nbeat all the best men of that country and\nretired. I was then 39 years of age, and had\nbeen in the ring nineteen years. I have\nfought more battles than Jem Mace, Joe\nCoburn, John C. Heenan and John Morris-\nsey all put together.\n\nThe dirtiest deal I ever got, and I have\nhad some prétty hard ones, was in my\nfight with Joe Goss. After I had been\nrobbed out of the fight and I got back\nto Cincinnati, Johnny Dyer, one of Goss’\nseconds, said he would fight me for $1,000.\nHe was just what I wanted, as he had\ndone me a great lot of dirt when I was\nfighting Goss. We put up a $250 forfeit to\nfight in four weeks, but he forfeited. That\nwas the last I heard of him until I was\nacross the water. Then I saw he was chal-\nlenging any man in America. I was, mind\nyou, in England. Dave Kendal, Eph. Hol-\nland, the referee, Black Edwards, a Cin-\ncinnati newspaper man, and Red Leary, got\nabout $10,000 out of my fight with Goss,which\nI was swindled out of on a claim of foul.\nThat was the first fight this man ‘“Macon,”’\nas J. B. McCormack calls himself, ever saw.\nHe was on the Enquirer then. The reason\nI mention his name is that he is giving his\nopinions in the papers about the prize ring\nof thirty years ago, and comparing the\nfighters of that time with the bum boxers of\nto-day. There is John L. Sullivan, “Ma-\ncon's’ idol, and the greatest man he ever\nsaw fight. Let's see what his opinion and\nJohn L. Sullivan amount to. Billy Madden,\nan old beer-slinger of mine, took Jack Sul-\nlivan to New York, and matched him\nagainst a big dock-walloper named Flood.\nThey boxed on a barge, and Sullivan won.\nHe next beat Jimmy Elliott, a blind man,\nthat Charley Gallagher beat in two rounds\nin 1868, when all the crooks from New York\nbroke into the ring. Jim Corbett, of Phila-\ndelphia, the partner of Dan Noble, who is\nnow doing twenty years in England, was\nreferee, ;\n\nSO-CALLED CHAMPIONS.\n\nPaddy Ryan called himself champion of\nAmerica by beating Joe Goss, who. was\nnever champion of anywhere, because\nJohnny Dyer forfeited $250 to me at Cincin-\nnati three days after my fight with Goss.\nDyer and Elliott fought for the champion-\nship of America. So I don’t see any man\nthat Sullivan ever met that was a cham-\npion. Charles Mitchell was never cham-\npion of England and never fought for that\ntitle, but he had so much to say that you\nwould think he was Shan of Jupiter\nand this earth was too small to think about.\n\nThen there was Tug Wilson, a man old\nenter. to be Sullivan's father, and a 140-\npound man, The next man is Alf Green-\nfield. He boxed Sullivan four rounds in\nBoston. The papers sald he could have\nknocked Sullivan out, but he was afraid to\ndo so. This man Greenfield was working on\na canal near Birmingham, England, when 1\ntook him in hand. I showed him how to box,\nbut I could not learn him how to fight. z.\ngot Greenfield to fight at Lord Lonsdale’s\nestate, Tug Wilson was the other fellow.\nThe Prince of Wales and the gentlemen who\nsaw them _ with the bare knuckles were\ndisgusted. reenfield and Wilson are both\nin Sullivan's terrible record. Everybody\nfrom St. Paul to San Francisco has beat\nthe Maori and Patsey Cardiff.\n\nThen comes the biggest farce I ever saw\nin my thirty-four years’ experience in the\nprize ring. Sullivan and Kilrain pulled and\ntugged at each other for over seventy\nrounds. Sullivan stood in the middle of\nthe ring in the fiftieth round Teay and\nnot able to move a foot. Kilrain asked him\nto make a draw and would not go at him.\nNo pe could call that fighting. Then Kil-\nrain fell down, and this “greatest of pugi-\nlists’’ deliberately jumped on him, not only\nonce, but twice. It was foul, but Sullivan\ncould not have lost if he had kicked Kil-\nrain’s head off. Prof. Mike Donovan can\nprove this. ‘‘Macon” calls this record a\nworld-beater. Then John turned actor and\nwent to Australia. Joe Goddard followed\nhim and challenged him in every town he\nshowed in. He got back to this country on\nthe bum and borrowed money to bring him\nand his actors back. After three years of\nfroin i he agreed to box Corbett. As he\nwould not box for less than $10,000 a side\nhe thought no man could raise that amount\nes eo on eg a not Fog\nmuc! ting. hat Cor had to do\nwas just to walk 'round while Sullivan stood\nlike ‘““Ajax defying the lightning\", for\ntwenty rounds and never touched Corbett\nonce. In the last round Corbett just let go\nhis left and right, and down went “Ajax.’\n\nAfter this ‘Macon’ McCormack shook\nthe “world-beater’’ J. L., and took Corbett\non his staff. I, for myself, think that Jim\nCorbett is without doubt the greatest boxer\nof the day, but the way he acts don’t show\nthat he is very willing to take the gaff, or\nhe would have taken on Fitzsimmons and\nboxed in three months for $35000. I think\nhe could have won, and very easily at that;\nbut as for Corbett saying that the men 25\n\nears were not as clever as they are to-\nLay, \"beg to differ with him.\n\nBox of oie and Juris ting are\ntwo erent trades. A man to a pee\nfighter must learn to strike straigh\ncannot sop a blow with his arms, like a\nman can with boxing §loves on.

That is what\n\n'S FAVORITE BLOW.\n\na have seen Fitzsimmons fight and\n\ne won both fights with his favorite right\nhand. The first fight I saw was with Peter\nMaher. They had no sooner got their hands\nup than Fitzsimmons swung his right half-\narm blow with the thumb face of love\n4c on the point of the jaw with a pull or a\n\nalf swing. Down went Peter, but Fitz\nnever swung that right ain, for he had\n80 injured his thumb with that one blow\nthat he never tried to use his right again\nCE fight with Jem Hall he\ne\nHe was swinging all over org rg\nHall, but not within a foot of Jem's head\nIn fact, Hall made a monkey of him and\nwas too confident. Soon as time was called\nfor the next round Fitzsimmons walked\nEnt over to Hall's corner and let go\nthe right with a half pull with the thumb\njust on the point of the jaw, just as if Hall\nwas a green-horn just come off a farm\nIf Hall had never seen a pair of boxing\ngloves in his iife he could not have done\nany worse. Fitzsimmons took that chance\nand It got away with it. I think that Fitz-\nsimmons is one of the luckiest men in the\nworld. It goes to show how easy it is to be\na boxer. You can count them by the hun-\ndreds, champions of States, champions of\ncounties and champions of the wards, and\nthe man that calls himself champion of\nthem all. He won't only box when he feels\nlike boxing. That is, every two or three\nyears. He says he will not take any notice\nof Peter because he is getting old and stale\nThat is all rot. I should think it would be\nall the easier for Corbett. They can box in\nEngland and he knows it. They can box in\nAmerica to a finish. They would not have\nmade a match to box in fitteen months, only\nthey wanted to be actors. The public is to\nblame for going to their shows. They would\nbox oftener if their houses were smaller.\nTHOS.

Sullivan will\nrun as an independent candidate for Mayor\nof Boston this fall with the added intention,\n§f not himself elected, of defeating Mayor\nJosiah Quincy, who will be the regular\nDemocratio candidate for re-election.\n\nWhen Mayor Quincy refused to shakes\nhands with John L. Sullivan, a native of\nBoston, at Oarsman Ten Hyck's reception\nto Feneull Hall, he committed what may\nprove to be a fatal political mistake. Sul-\nlivan was dumfounded. According to one\nof the Mayor's official organs, the big\nfighter was easily the idol of the occasion.\nThe crowd chased and cheered him. Ten\nEyck was almost ignored at times,\n\nSullivan's amazement at the slight Es\ngpon him by Mayor Quincy gradually\nchanged to anger, and this anger has be-\ncome vindictiveness.\n\nAt first, after thinking the matter over,\nbe was inclined to content himself with\nsupporting an anti-octopus nominee like\nMr. Wardner or Judge Sianker. Now he\nhas crossed the Rubicon and put his foot\nthrough the bridge timbers.\n\nJohn L. Sulilvan will now ask the sup-\nport of his fellow citizens at the polls. At\none t.me he could have gone to Congress,\nbut he declined. Then his professional du-\nties were in the way. Now he feels that\nhe can spare the time to serve his towns-\namen.\n\nThere is nothing unprecedented about Sul-\nlivan announcing himself a candidate for\nMayor of even so staid and steady a town\nas Boston\n\nThe prize ring has brought better men\nthan Sullivan 10 the front in politics.\n\nThe Sullivan-Kilrain fight—which took\n\nlace at Richburg, Miss., eight years ago—\n§rougnt to the front the best Mayor, New\nOrleans has ever had.\n\nWho that was there will ever forget that\nfearful day in July?\n\nThe trip to the battle ground was an all-\nnight one, and St. Louis was weil repre-\nsented in the big crowd which made the\nJourney.\n\nTom Allen and Tom Kelly were there, and\n£0 were Fred Watkins and Jake Esher, who\nare now fighting their battles in another\nland. Abe Slupsky was there, too, with\nDan, Charley and John Daly. Bo, too, was\nBob Farrell. Those of the St. Louis grog\nwho are still in the land of the living wil\nrecall the one startling incident before the\nfight. Its managers had charged $10 for\ntickets to Richburg and when the crowd\nreached there it was announced that an-\nother charge of $5 would be made for seats\naround the ring.\n\n“Don’t pay it,” shouted a brawny, broad-\nshouldered man, as the crowd from the\ntrain surrounded the ring only to be con-\nfronted with the demand for the extra $.\n“Don't pay it. Be men. Stand out against\nthis highway robbery. They have already\ncharged $10 for a ride in a cattle car. Now\nthey propose to hold us up for another $.\nFollow me men. Let us take charge here.”\n\nAll that crowd needed was a leader.\n\nThe strange man led and the mob fol-\nlowed. There were none there so bold as\nto dare to bar the way of that army.\nWhen it was seated and quiet and order\nrestored there were cries for a referee, but\nno one dared accept the place.\n\nThe men suggested for the position by\nBullivan's friends were not to the Kilrain\nmen’s lLking. It looked as though there\nwould be no fight owing to the absence of\na referee, when Tom Kelly of St. Louis\nshouted: ‘There's a man there that would\nmake a good referee. What's the matter\nwith him?\"\n\nAll hands looked at the individual whom\nKelly had singied out of the motley gather-\ning. They recognized him as the brawny\nfellow of the few moments before who had\nled them into the ring and helped them hold\npossession of it. Like Kelly, too, they\nrecognized him as the man for the place,\nand from one end of the ring to the other\nthe welkin rang with cries of ‘“Yes, yes,\nhe’s the man; he'll do.”\n\nThe brawny fellow was cornered. He\nstood his ground for a moment, begged in\na manly way to be excused, and then, as\nthe mob thundered its demand, he capltu-\nlated and took up his place in the roped\narena.\n\nThe fight was for the championship of all\nthe world. A king's ransom depended on\nthe issue. But here to decide the great\npoints of the conteat was chosen a man\nunknown to those who had the great battle\nin charge and unknown to the vast army\nof sports who had come from all corners of\nthe world to see it.\n\nBut the unknown proved the best in all\nthe wide world for the place. Only once\nwas one of his decisions questioned. That\nwas when Pony Moore, one of Kilrain's\nbackers, said: “He has money on the\nfight.”\n\nThen there was a pause in the proceed-\n{oss The referee stopped the fight just\nong enough to look Moore in the face and\nto say, “Take that back!\"\n\nMoore took it back, and so quickly that\nthe crowd around the ring side scarcely no-\nticed the Interruption.\n\nThe man who refereed that fight by his\nsingle bold act leaped from obscurity into\nnational notoriety. He gained for h:mself\nin a single hour the reputation of being a\nman of nerve and good judgment and that\nin the south means everything.\n\nThat notoriety made John Fitzpatrick the\nbest known man in New Orieans and a\nyous after the Sullivan-Kilrain fight had\n\naken place this same John Fitzpatrick was\nelected Mayor of he Crescent City.\n\nIt has often been said since that he was\nthe best Mayor, New Orleans has ever had.\ning body Sale + not the only man who\n\nas jumped from the pri i ti-\na) Dac prize ring into politi\n\nJohn Morrissey of Troy, N.

He ws 5 feit 8, inches tall and\nwhen he was in the ring his fighting weight\nwas 175 pounds. Allen began his pugilistic\ncareer in the old country in 1861. He fought\nseveral st.ff battles, including a draw with\nJoe Goss in March, 137. He came to this\n\n| country in the following July, ands in the\n| very first ring event in which he partici-\npated a revolver and threats to kill played\nstar parts.\n\nAllen had been selected to second THmmy\n| Kelly of Baltimore n a finish fight with\n| Billy Parkinson of Pottsville, Pa. The mill\ntook place at Acquia Creek, Vermont. The\nfight was for a $2.30 purse. Parkinson was\n| teared by the backers of Kelly, and a large\n| crowd of thugs and bullies accompanied\n| Keily from Baltimore and Philadelphia. It\n| was arranged between them to start a row\nif the referee didn't give the fight to their\nman. William ¥E. Harding, then sporting\neditor of a Naw York daily, and afterward\npreeminent through hls connection with a\nsporting weekly publishea on pink paper,\nwas the referee,\n\nFrom the first round Parkinson began to\nhand it up to Kelly so cleverly that Tom\nAllen went wild. Before the signal to start\n\n| the wrangle he pulled forth a long navy\n| pistol and announced that he would kiil\n| Harding If Kelly d dn’t get the decision on\n| alleged fouls. Kelly's friends crowded\n! around the referee and for a moment it\nlooked as though Harding would be kiiled,\n| Allen, who led the crowd, was desperate\n| to the point of doing murder. But Harding\n| would not be intimidated. and Allen, fol-\n| lowed by his ruffianly mob, cut the ropes\n| and carried Kelly out of the ring. Parkin-\n{ son was, of course, declared the winner.\n\nAllen's first battle in America was with\nBill Davis. The fight was pulled off on\nChouteau Island, mear St. Louis, Jan. 12,\n1869. Allen won in 43 rounds. He next tried\non Charle Gallagher of Cleveland, the tight\ntaking place on Carroll Island, mear St.\nlL.ouis, the following Feb. 24. Allen was\nlad low after a terrific three minutes of\nfighting.\n\nMike McCoole of St. Louis and Allen\nfought on Foster's Island, July 15, for a\n$100 purse and all of the excursion money.\nA great crowd of St. Louisans went to see\nthe mill, and they saw Allen give his ad-\nversary a mighty whaling. They also saw\na bloody free-for-all riot started by the\nMceCoole crowd. Clubs were wielded, while\nthe referee was besieged by angry brutes\narmed with murdgrous weapons, who sav-\nagely demanded a decision in favor of the\nhelpless, shapeless bleeding mass of hu-\nmanity who had been a chopping block for\nAllen.” These rows were characteristic of\nalmost every fight Allen ever had.\n\nAllen afterwards took on Charley Galla-\ngher a second time, defeating him on Fos-\nter's 1sland, Aug. 17, 1869. The crowd in-\nterfered as usfial and Gallagher was de-\nclared the winner, though fairly whippel.\n\nAllen's best known fight was with Jem\nMace at Kinnerville, near New Orieans,\nLa., May 10, 1870. Sporting men from all\nover the country congregated to witness\nthe fight. It was a short and bloody\nbattle. Mace was too much for Allen and\nwon the $000 prize in ten rounds.\n\nJoe Coburn declined to fight \"Allen and\nMike McCoole was accommodated with a\nsecond contest. They fought on Chouteau\nIsland, Sept. 23. 1873. Allen made quick\nwork of McCoole, punishing him so bruatal-\nly that the spectators begged MecCoole's\nseconds to take him out of the ring,\n\nAllen's last fight was with the famous\nJoe Goss for the championship of America\nand $2000. The fight took place in Boone\nCounty, Ky., in 1876. After 21 rounds Goss\nwas declared winner on a foul. After the\nficht Allen was arrested and jailed in that\n\n| State on a charge of prize fighting. He\n| was released on bond, jumped his bond and\nwent to England. After a year on the other\n| side, which he put in on the race tracks,\n| he returned to this country and he then\n| created something of a sensation in New\n| York by offering to fight John L. Sullivan,\n| After issuing that challenge, which never\n| | bore fruit, Allen returned to St. Louis and\n| opened his saloon on Market st.\nSoon after his return his Kentucky bonds-\n| men appeared here with requisition papers\n» | for his arrest as a fugative from justice.\n| Allen's lawyers secured his release by writ\n| | of habeas corpus which iwas argued before\n- I Judge Claiborne in the Court of Criminal\n| Correction. On hearing the testimony the\ncourt ordered Allen's release and his Ken-\ntucky bbndsmen returned home without\ntheir man. Allen's last appearance in any\nring as a boxer was on July 4, 1834 at\n\nUnion Baseball Park when he and Tom\n\nKelly boxed four friendly rounds.",

Althouzh he has\nimproved in the laet day or two and hopes\n\n| to be about agaln shorily, his sickness has\n‘ reduced him considerably and has caused\nhim considerable pain.\n\nThe veteran has been complaining of\npains in the regions where his opponents’\npunches landed in vears gone by, and states\nthat his arms, ribs and stomach region have\nLeen throbbing where they sustamed pun-\nishment in his battles of the past.\n\nAllen was a representative fighter of the\nold school and of the bygone bare-knuckle\ndays. Ile started his ring career when 21\nyears oid, in 1860, and for eighte»n years\nhe was a prominent factor among he fore-\nmost men in his class. Born in 1339, he\ntook up the ring rather later ttan do most\nof the pugilists nowadays, and he continued\nat the game until his celesrated battle for\nthe championship of England, when Le\n\n| knocked out Charlie Davis mn five rounds.\nThis was the first champlonship battle\nfought in England under Queensberry rules.\nAs a reward he received a purse of 11%\nand a massive silver oup, emblematic of the\ntitle, which now hangs over his bar.\n\nIn 1867 he fought the then celebrated Joe\nGoss for the heavy-weight championship,\nthe bout ending in a rict and Allen's sec-\nonds being mobbed. In 1870 he fought Jem\nMace In Louisiana for the heavy-weight\nchampionship and a purse of $5,000, Allen's\nseconds throwing up the sponge at the end\nof ten roWnds, after Tom had Injured his\narm. The bout lasted fifty minutes.\nAllen's A ath around this city are weil\nremembered, especially his battles with\nMike McCool on Bloody Island. He beat\nMcCoo] there in seven rounds,\n\nDon Murphy, manager of Allen's oan\nstated that he believed the veteran woul\nbe out again soon, but that the effects of\nhis illness had told on him considerably.\n\nNick Santora, who defeated RoE, Sulli-\nvan in the pre ninays at the est End\nClub last Thursday, wiil be one of the at-\ntractions in the preliminaries next week,\nwhen Jeffries and Fitzsimmons appear\nhere. Santora displayed great cleverness in\nhis battle. and the boy seems to be about\nas promising a youngster as there 1s in\nthe ring at his weight.\n\nDominick has none of the clumsiness\nusually apparent in boys of the 105-pound\ndivision and thereabouts, but handles both\nhis feet and hands well. He has footwork\ndown to a finer point than Sullivan, and\nundoubtedly is one of the hardest men at\nhis weight ever here.\n\nHe is now not re 17 years old, and\nhas been fighting little more than a year.\nHe has lost bul one battle and forfeited\none on a foul. All his bouts, save that of\nlast Thursday, have been fought in Chi-\ncago. His record to date is: Knocked out\nShay Sorensen in four rounds; knocked\nout Young Slasher In four rounds; knocked\nout Nell Simons, four rounds; drew with\nCarl Walters, six rounds; lost on foul to\nGeorge Quinn, flve rounds; drew with Geo.\nQuinn, six rounds; knocked out Danny Gil-\nlen, ene round; drew with Frank Lucas,\nsix rounds; knocked out Neill S!mons, two\nrounds; lost to Ge Kelly, six rounds;\nwon from Frank ucas, six rounds;\n\nknocked out Buddy Glover, three rounds;\nwon from Sport Sullivan, eight rounds.\n\nHugo Kelly, who won from Mike Schreck\nThursday, will depart to-night for Chi-\ncago, thence heading for West Baden.

Jim Corbett's age\ntells against him in the opinfon of many\npersons, inasmuch as he has seen his thir-\nty-seventh year. All these men are products\nof the padded-giove period.\n\nOld Tom Allen, however. also fogght\nwhen the bare fists cut and battereq¥ing\nflesh, who figured In battles lasting thr®ugh\nhours In the open air and fought In snow\nwith the temperatare close to the zero\nmark, who went through contests when\nmobs broke into the ring and bettered the\nfighters around, was still a champlonship\nfactgr in his fortteth year, and was not\nconsidered a has-been by a great deal.\n\nAllen was re” ind it {s true. But\nold Tom Kelly, 8ho is another veteran of\nbygone pupae days and who still calls\nthis ip Is home, fought bare-knuckle\n\n: battleg ong after the time at which men\n\n| retire’ from the ring nowadays. Enough\n\n¢ instances may be hoes in looking over\n+ old-time peesistic Istory, to Jrose that\nthe ring life of the bare-knuckle fighters,\ncontrary to the general bellef on the point,\nwas at least as long as that of the boxers\ncf to-day.\n\nTwo reasons may be given for this. One\nis the fact that the old-time battles were\nfought In the open alr. The other, that\nspeed was less essantial in the bare-knuckle\ndays than It is at present,\n\nThe open-air battles, even when fought in\na driving sncwstorm, as they ofen were,\nprobably proved far less injurious to a\nman than a bout of to-day, conducted in a\nheated hall reeking with tobacco smoke.\nThe fighters at least had pure air to\nbreathe. And the value of this can be esti-\nmated by those who have noted the num-\nber of men collapsing as modern boxers\nafter a short course of Lheatrical life,\n\nSteady ioe En of the alr In a crowded\ntheater each night, even when the man\nhave remained in such an atmosphere but\na few hours each day, has sapped the vi-\ntality from several champions, Steady work\nin a crowded bexing hall, where the lungs\nof the men araw tobacco smoke in with\neach panting breath, has undoubtediy\nproved more injurious to many a fighter\nthan his opponent's blows.\n\nThen as to the matter of speed. A man\nloses that extreme edge of speed quicker\nthan he loses his strength. To-day, speed\nis an absolute essential; a man without it\nmight just as well not enter the ring. In\nthe old days, when the men set themselves\nfor their blows 2nd sent in their >unches\nto do damage with each stroke, this ex-\ntreme speed was not =o essential.\n\nThe loss of this ¢dge of speed removes\na man from the front rank to-day. In the\nold days a man was serviceable so long as\nhie muscles were still in good trim and his\nstrength was not waning. The res.lt was\nthat a fighter of ability might have a ring\ncareer at 1 as long as that of the ring\nheroes of to-day.\n\nConsiderable interest was aroused by the\n\n| announcement of Allen's illness in yester-\nday's Republic, and the record of the old-\ntimer was talked over among the fight lov-\ners of the city. The contrast between the\nbattles of to-day, In halls lined with police\nand where order prevails, and the cele-\nbrated bout between Allen and Joe Goss,\n| when the ring was broken, revolvers drawn, |\nseconds forced from their principals at ihe |\nmuzzles of guns and the ring stormed by |\n\na mob, furnished a lively topic of d'scus- |\nsion. 8\n\nThe fight in question occurred in 1867 and\nwas contested late In September on a\nstormy day. The affair was for a side bet\nof $2,500, and after a battle of thirty-seven\nrounds, lasting one hour and fifty minutes,\nfriends of Goss Des into the ring and\nthreatened to kill Alien and his seconds.\nTwo men known as Red Leary and Blinky\nMorgan burst into the ring with drawn re-\nvolvers and drove his seconds away.\n\nAt that time, Goss was clearly ‘beaten\nand was entirely blinded by Allen's blows.\nTom was hardly injured in the fight, but\nin the subsequent attack by the mob he\nwas shot in the hand and was hit in the\neye with a club. Red Leary and 1\nboth met violent deaths, Leary being killed\nthrough being hit In the stomach with a\nel while Morgan was hanged at Colum-\n\nus,\n\nAnother memorable fight of Allen's was in\n1870, when He met Jem Mace in Loulsiana\nfor the ehampionshid of the world and a\nside bet of $2,600. Alien was badly punched\nin the body in the course of this fight, and\nhis seconds threw up the sponge at the end\nof ten rounds. The contest lasted ffty\nminutes.\n\nIn 1878, Allen fought Charlie Davis in Eng-\nland under Queensberry rules, putting him\naway in five rounds. This gave him the\nBritish championship. His most notable\nfights locally, however, were those fought\nin the vicinity of this city. In one fight, he\nmet Mike McCool on Bloody Island, win-\nning easily in seven rounds.\n\nTom Kelly, who alsq lives In this hs is |\nanother veteran of bare-knuckle-days, hav-\ning been born in Roscommen County, Ire-\nland, in 1836. He battled around pounds\nand was one of the best known put ists of\nhis day. His ring career extended over\nlonger period than that of most modern\npugitiste, and while he never fought in this\ncountry, his record of battles on the other\nside rt § the water Is a Jeugehy one. The\nfact that he frequently attended Donny-\nbrook Fair and still survives attests his\nability.\n\nOne thing may be added, however, and ]\nthat is, that it was the successful puaitista |\nwho had the lengthy careers In the iy, 2\nDefeat In a bare-knuckle battle generally |\nmeant a terrible pounding and often serv\nbroken jaws and ribs.

Becoming lI, he was\nnursed by a woman who claimed he was\nto marry her after he recovered. She was\n\n» wet to be divorced from her husband. Allen\n\n/ still had a wife living in Birmingham, Eng-\n\n0 Allen's place oa Market street, which\nYears ago was given thé name of “The\nChampion's Rest” and the headquarters of\nthe ““Aiblon Social Club.” is to-day one of\nthe most notorious resorts in the city, not\nthat it is in any way dangerous, but that\nit is the resting place of & large number of\nthe cily’'s unfortunates who have no means\nwith which to secure a place to rest.\n\nFor years “Old Tom,” as his patrons were\nwont to style him, personally conducted the\naffairs of the “Champion's Rest.” His char-\nacteristic pose was to preside over the\nplano and direct the concert which took\nplace nightly.\n\nSix weeks ago, when Allen took to his\nbed, he was given the best of attention.\nWhen his condition became serious he was\nremoved to the Baptist Hospital. From\nthe time he was taken there until his death\nhe was in a comatose condition, rarely if\never recognizing anybody.\n\nMADE NO WILL\n\nAccording to his friends, efforts to ob- |\ntain from him a statement or to induce him\nto make a wiil are said to have been frult-\nless. |\n\nAfter the champion was removed to the |\nhospital from his rooms over the saloon, |\nvarious persons endeavored to secure an in- |\nterview with him. Principally ME these |\nwas his daughter, Mrs. Mary Taylor, cf\nNo. 3427 Clark avenue. BShe discredited the\nreport that her father was to marry Bis |\nnurse, Mrs. Tillie Hartgraven.\n\nMre. Taylor attempted to secure an in-\nterview with her father, but this was de-\nnied her, because, it was stated, he\nwas In no condition to receive visitors. |\nAbout the game time, J. W. L. Gillespie ap- |\npeared at the “Rest” and attempted to take\nperp claiming he had been given a\n\n1 of sale for the place by Allen.\n\nJohn Murphy, who has been one of Al-\nJen's faithful employes for many years,\n%nowing that the champion was unécn-\nscious and in no condition to give a bill of\nsale, declined to surrender the place and\nordered a away.\n\nFollowing the Gillespie incident, it is\nclaimed, a safety deposit box, which |\nAllen kept, has been broken into and $39, |\ntogether with a watch and chain, the latter l\ngiven the champion by an admiring friend |\nyears ago, stolen. i\n\nAllen's body is at the undertaking es-!\ntablishment of Thomas Wand. Litigation |\nover his estate probably will be institu-ed\nbefore the funeral arrangements are com-\nleted, as his daughter, Mrs Taylor, has |\n\nBeclared that she will apply to the courts |\nto-day to secure protection for her father's |\nproperty.\n\nCAREER OF PUGILIST.\n\n\\ Tom Allen was born at Birmingham, |\n\nEngland, April 22, 1535. His first fight of\n\nconsequence was on April 20, 1860, when\n= Raluatut a by ihe re of ran\nin England, in ten rounds. is longes\nfight was fifty rounds with Bob Smith, Jane\n2, 1864, when he was defeated.\n\nAllen fought eleven important fights in|\nPngland.

The fight took |\nplace near St. Louis and lasted thirty-seven J |\nrounds. In this round Allen landed a blow °\nthat pt Goss to the ground.

Thieves |\nhe could not tolerate and drove them from |\nhis establishment as soon as their identity |\nwas made known. |\n\nOnce the prospective visitor had made\nup his mind to enter the place and cross |\nthe threshold, he found himself in the\n“tap room,” as Allen was wont to refer to\nit. On the right was the dingy walnut\ncounter with a mirror in back, in front of |\nwhich was piped, the cup emblematic of\nAllen's Engli ampionship victory. On\nthe left was a row of stalls.\n\nBeyond was the concert hall, still main-\ntained as such. In the northwest corner\nwas the prize ring in which bouts of some\nsort, many of them desperate, were held\nnightly. On the opposite side of the hall\nwas a ralsed platform on which was\n\nplaced the plano.\n\nHe Was Master\n\nof Ceremonies.\n\nNear this was a table at which the cham-\nfon himself sat with a small gavel in\n\nPana and a black skull cap on his head,\ndirecting the evening's entertainment.\n\nHe was referee of all fights, director of\n\nthe musical entertainment and arbitrator\nof all diffictlties that 150 one arise. In the\nearly dave of the establishment these were\nnot a few.\nWhenever two guests thought it neces-\nsary to throw a few hot words and get\nviolent, Tom promptly rapped his gavel.\nAt once the walters dropped their tasks\nand flocked to the scene of action, where\nthe combatants were separated, gloves\ntied on their hands, and they were told to\nclimb into the ring and have their argu-\n‘ment out there\n\nThis had a triple advantage; it offset\npolice interference, ended the difficulty to\nthe satisfaction of the agsrioved parties\nand afforded infinite entertainment to the\nspectators.\n\nAs soon as one or the other of the com-\nbatants signified that his honor was\nave d or that he had had about all he\nrobes stand at one taking, the ring was\ncleared and the concert permitted to pro-\nceed.\n\nSometimes the encounters were desperate\nand savage, however. A few vears after\nAllen had opened his place, Tom Kelly\nonened a similar groggery In the same\nblock, while Danny Daly, father of sév-\neral pugilistic celebrities opened a place\naround the corner on Sixth street.\n\nThe rivalry for patronage between these\nthree places was intense, and each had its\ncoteric of followers, most of whom were\npuglitsts, ready to ht at the vgs 3 of\nan evelld, and at all times ready So old\nthe claims of thelr respective establish-\nments,\n\nThe bitterness thus engendered resulted\nin street brawls, saloon fights and ring\ncombats.\n\nFeud Led to\n\nsia pr one of ° ¥ y= , »\n| a oh De. Sgn\n\nout after a viclous and brutal scrap. That\n\nwas later, in 1892.\n\nEven old Tom himself, though he was\nlong out of the game, occasionally took a\nhand in the fray. Once or twice the enemy,\nprimed with raw spirits dared to invade\ntha old lion in his lair and proceeded to\nheap abuse on him. Then Allen proceeded\nto show his championship form and put\nthe enemy out bodily.\n\nOnce tha tables were turned on him. and,\nin an attempted invasion of Dan Daly's\n| “joint,” a fight occurred In which he and |\nDaly had it hammer and tongs clear cut\ninto the street. Daly whipped Allen— |\nabout the kmly occasion in which the\n| champion ever finished second after leaving |\n| the ring. |\n| With constant brawling and scrapping to}\n| enliven it this feud, growing more bitter\neach year, lasted until the death of Daly\nin 1805. It is natural to suppose that, under\n| the circumstances, Allen would have been\nglad rather thgn otherwise that his ancient\nenemy had been finally disposed of. Such\nwas not the case, however. It was char-\nacteristic of the man that he was one of\nthe flrst to go to Daly's relatives, follow-\ning the news of the death. and offer his\nservices and substantial aid in money,\n\nWith Daly .the feud dled. and the wane\nof the prize fighting feature of the “Cham-\npion’s Rest” began. There were fewer occa-\nsions for fights, and, who knows, perhaps\neven the old champion himself wearled of\ncontinual turmoil. broil and unrest.\n\nFighting was far from being the sole\nfeature of the establishment, however, in\nthe earlier days. Allen was a lover of mu-\ngic. In a way it was a sort of paradox of\nnature, for, in the ring as a fighter, he is\nsald to have been one of the most savage\nand vicious men who ever fought under\nLondon prize ring rules. He had to be\nkilled to be beaten, and it was his bulldog\ntenaci®y of purpose that pulled him\nthrough on top of many engagements.\nBallads Were\n\nHis Delight.\n\nHis appreciation of, tender ballads, rol-\nlicking songs and even classical music was\nof the keenest and in his later days he\nwould rather listen to a song than see\na prize fight. Almost the first thing he\npurchased when he fitted up his place was\nthe piano—the same one that now wheezes\nout popular and mournful airs under the\nfingers of the gray-haired veteran who\nfor 15 years has performed the service of\n“musical director” under Allen's guidance.\n\nIn Sepa the “‘Rest\"” presents\npractically the same features, accord-\ning to the testimony of the “Belfast Chick-\nen,” Tom Kelley and others in a postion\nto speak authoritatively, as It did when\nfirst opened, nearly a quarter of a cen-\ntury ago.

His conduct of his concerts\nwas with an assumption of dignity that\n| would have been laughable had it not been\nfn deadly earnest, as many found who\n| came to scoff.\n\n| Concert Was\n\na Ceremony.\n\nGradually he impressed the idea upon the\nregulars of the establishment that a con-\ncert was a ceremony and not a performance.\nIts unvarying routine bore out this Idea.\nAs often as one went to the place the code\nnever changed, save for incidental inter-\nruptions foreign to the program, such\nas the suppression of an obstreperous ono,\nor the substitution of a new musical num-\nber for a wornout one.\n\nAllen had a good idea of economy and he\npracticed it in his place.

The mill went 21 rounds and Alen\nlost on an intentional foul. He saw that\nhis life was in danger If he won and delib-\nerately struck Goss while he > im down, The\nbattle ground was in Boone County, on the |\nfarm of the father of Rome Respess, the\nwell-known Cincinnati horseman. Goss was\ndeclared champion of America.\n\nThe fight was attended with many excit-\ning incidents. Eph Holland, at the time one\nof the leading sports and promoters of the\nQueen City, was the prime mover of the\naffair. The day's events will be readily re-\ncalled by hundreds of Clincinnatians, who\nremember what a time there was,\n\nJem Wace brought Goss to the country\nwith him, and the latter took ud his head-\nquarters in Cincinnatl. Goss and Allen be-\ning English born and aspiring for the same\nhonor a feeling of Ditterneas sprang up be- |\ntween them. A match was arranged after\nsome wrangling. The stake was $2,000 a\nside, which at that time was considered a |\nlarge amount to bdattle for in the ring. |\nWhaen the men signed the articles it was\nnoted that both were baldheaded. This cre- |\nated much amusement among the sports,\nand the match was frequently referred to\nas the \"Old Men's Bout.” The fighters\ntrained in this city. Goes prepared —rd\nnear Comminsville, while Allen went to a\npoint beyond Carthage, where he could ~\njoy the fresh country alr. Allen, it is said,\ntrained faithfully, but Goss put in most of |\nhis time chatting with friends who came\nfrom Cincinnati to see him “work™ and in-\ncidentally drink a few dozen Bottles of ale.\nThe day of battie arrived.\n\nIt was early on the morn of September T\nin the year 1876 that the sports began to\nmove about. In the resorts around town\nnothing elise was talked of put the fight be-\ntween the two old baldheads Many of the\nfarthful stayed up all night so as not to\nmiss any of the early excitement incidental\nto the fight.\n\nEph Holland was the busiest man in\n\ntown. He was in charge of the special\ntrain which was to be run to the battle\nground, and was kept answering questions\nand giving instructions. The sports were\ntold to be at the Little Miam! Depot, at\nPearl and Butler streets, at an early hour,\nfrom which point the train would leave.\nWhen Holland and the backers of the men\nreached the depot they found a howling\nmob awaiting them. The special train was\nfilled with hoodlums, and it was Impossibie\nto get another soul on board. Holland had\nto resort to strategy to prevent a riot, as\nthe bums In possession of the train an-\nnounced that they would neither pay nor\ngive up thelr seats. Then it was that Hol-\nland put his wits to working. He had the\nyardmaster take the train scheduled to\nleave for the fight down the road some dis-\ntance, and when far from the battle ground\n‘the crowd on board was quickly informed\nthat the train would go no further. Out\nIn the wilderness the mob was left without\n‘a bite to eat and nothing to drink. An-\n‘other train was hastily made up In the\ndepot and the real moneyed men carried\nto the fighting ground. The “bum special”\ndid not get in until late in the evening, and\nthe sports who thought they were going\nto see the fight when they started, made\ntor their homes, too much chagrined to\nrejate their experience to those who made\ninquiries concerning the fight.\n\nThe regular fight train arrived at the\nscene of battle In Kenton County just about\nbreakfast time. The men prepared their\nrece and were soon at it _hot and heavy.\nIn the midst of the milling the cry was\n‘heard: “The soldiers are coming.” A\nglance convinced the sports that the militia\n| Jeere Spon them and the Sate was colored |\nstopped. The Captain of the militia told the\npromoters that they must not fight in Ken-\nton County. The mod then moved into the\nadjoining County of Boone, and there on a\nlevel plece of farming land the fight was\npulled off without further interference.\n\nThere was one woman spectator present\nShe sald her name was Gorman, and the\nsports made a plage for her at the ringside.\n| She had read of the fight match and seemed\nmuch interested.\n\nThe fight was started. Goss showed much\ncleverness, but it was plainly apparent\nthat Allen had the strength of the palr.\nEph Holland was referee, and what a time\nhe had. Every few seconds some one would\ncall him a vile name or set up the claim of\nfoul. The friends of Goss seemed to out-\nnumber the men on Allen's side, and it was\nnot long before it became noised adout that\nif Allen 414d win, his life would pay the pen-\nalty. Allen had Goss groggy. but every\ntime Allen knocked him down the Goss par-\noy would hoot old Tom so as to rattie\n\nm.\n\nIn the twenty-first round Allen rushed!\nGoss and planted a hard blow In the wind.\nGoss groaned and sat down. It was then\n\nthat the friends of Goss uttered violent\nthreats against Allen, and the latter be-\ncame frightened. He knew thet his life was\nin danger. Suddenly, with a determined\nlook in his eye, he walked over and smashed\nGoss, while he was attempting to rise. There\nwas a burst of indignation from Goss's sup-\nporters,-and a rough house ended the battle.\nGoss was given the decision, while Allen\nwas hooted from the ring. It was plainly\nevident that AHen could have whipped Goss\nto a certainty, but he was afraid to punch\nhim on account of the surroundings. Both\nmen were arrested, but Allen, after getting\ncut on ball, fled to England. Goss died years\nago in the city of Boston, while Allen, after\nreturning to this country, took up his abode\nin St. Louls, where he conducted a saloon\nknown as the “Champion Rest,” up until a\nfew weeks of his death. >\n. : gid i FEE ie BRAS ZT\n> Fe =. ga ~~ afin £5 E ST AES, x\nMEE , © Fa\nlf ji £ Nevap : PAX ig oR\nRib EP oT A 1 si 0\nCawmtia Sl\nE A] be Xs ar Sekt fre 2:\n£9 A Bis 24 Pr. ~~ HPI\npp gets\nwn hark ks Svar 3\nso nt b ¥ ; i\ngo a\nlo etn tns i 's i0 x 3",

This was consider-\ned a jarge sum In those days to depend upon\na nght.\n\nEph Holland, a Cincinnati sporting man.\nwas in c.arge of the affatr and selected a |\nsite in Kenton County as the place for the\nring. Arrangements had been made to\nhave a special train carry the sports across\nthe river, but this train was seized by a\nmob of toughs, who refused to leave the\ncars or to pay thelr fare.

They are trying\n\nto account for the ringing of Tom Al-\nlen’'s bell\n\nWhen Tom named the place *“‘Cham-\npion’s Rest,” he thought only of the rest\nfor his old age, which it was to be.\n\nTom Allen, retired champion pugilist and\nproprietor of Champion's Rest, in dying,\nleft much litigation.\n\nHis housekeeper, Tillie Hartgrove, took\npossession under a document purporting\nto be the will of Tom Allen, while Al-\nlen's daughter was left out in the cold,\nso far as a share in the inheritance went.\n\nProceedings to dispossess the house-\nkeeper were brought by the daugh-\nter before the father was fairly buried,\nbut the court probated the will and a\nmanager was put in to run the place.\n\nThis manager had been a bartender under\nAllen, and he knew the ways of Allen well\nenough to keep the old trade and run the\nplace as Allen had done. But he did not\nsee it that way, and the “Weary Willies”\nthat used to bunk under the piano were\nunceremoniously red out whenever the\nmidnight trade fell off enough to war-\nrant Sleting the doors that in Allen's time\naad never been locked\n\nThe nie ring simplicity that had\ncharacterized the place in the champlon's\nregime was to give ge to the tinsel and\nglitter af the modern bar. Sawdust was |\n\n| no longer to cover the oor, and g measur-\ner Irom a carpet house was called In to\nmake estimetes for a linoleum outfit.\n\noutside the door the old patrons of the\nplace often stopped and many a head ‘was\nshaken with the remark:\n\n“Poor, old Tom. Wouldn't he turn over\nin his grave at such goings on.”\n\nThe man from the carpet house was figur-\ning at a table In the concert hall, a table\noe Joe Allen used to sit and drink his ice\nwater. With him sat the manager and\ntwo tall glasses adorned the table.\n\nA sound of warring volees rose above the\nnoisa of traffic on the street, and the two\nmen went to the door.\n\nSuddenly the bell behind the bar rang.\n\nThere was only one push button connect-\ned with it and no one had i ropes it\nexcept Allen when he wanted a drink or a\nbouncer to quell a réot.\n\n“What are you doing to that bell, yon\nrascal?’ shouted the manager at the negro\nporter.\n\n“1 nevar tetched ft, sah,” returned the\nporter.\n\nAgain it sounded, more insistently than\nbefore.\n\nThe porter retreated to the end of the\nbar nearest the door and again the bell\nrang out followed Dy a crash of glasses.\n\nThe manager was game, and he walked\nback into the concert hall.\n\nThere on the table where the carpet\nsalesman had been figuring was a pool of\nwhat had been ‘“‘forty-rod’ whisky high-\nballs. Both glasses were broken and the\nestimate of the salesman, which had been\nwritten with an indelible pencil, blotted\nand blurred beyond the power of man to\ndecipher.\n\n“What was it,”\" sald the carpet man, “a\ncat?”\n\n“Cats don’t ring bells,”” said the manager,\n“and we haven't a cat about the place.”\n\n“Well, what do you think it was?\" insist- |\nel the carpet man as he started to make\nout a new estimate on the linoleum ques-\ntion.\n\n“1 don't think anything about fit; but\nsay, we might as well call this deal off.\nTom Allen don’t want no linoleum on his\nfloor and I guess sawdust will be the car-\npet of this place while I run it.\n\nThe new plate glass mirrors were taken\nout the same day and the old wrinkled one\nput back behind the bar. The place Is\nagain just as Tom Allen left it and the old\ntrade is coming back to be well received.\n\nThis mystery has not been brought to\nthe nolice of the Society for Psychical Re-\nsearch as yet, but the Market street world\ngrows more confident each day that it was\nnothing else than the spirit of Tom Allen\ncome back to this world to make known to\nthe new regime that the old ways and sur-\nroundings had been good enough for him\nam to protest against the planned innova-\n\nions.\n\nOver the push button will be placed a\nbox, that no strange hand may press it\nunawares. As for the habitues, they give\nthat table a wide berth, not. as they sav,\nthat they are afraid, but, “Tom might not\nlike it, you know,” 1s the reason assigned.\n\nNone of the many visitors of the past few\ndays has failed to be impressed with the\nstory except an advance agent of a weil-\nknown actress, who was run out of the\nplace !n a hurry because he winked at the\nmanager during the telling of the story.\n\nheli Sobran oe",

Gllilesple, proprietor of the saloon\nwhich was graced for a brief season with\n| the name of “Lord” Barrington’'s Bar,\n| says that he loaned the hat to Barrington\nLin order to enabliie him to present a re-\n “pectable appearance, and that Barrington\nfailed to return it when he severed his con-\n| nection with the establishment.\n\n| Rarrington denies. This the authorities\n| 2t the Clayton jail have come to regard as\n| his regular procedure, but they say he wiil\nbe allowed to keep the hat unless Gillespie\nor Mrs. Hartgrove brings a replevin suit\nLO recover it.",

Gillesple\norders the unmannerly patron to be seatad,\nand if he falls to sit down immediately there\nis a strong-armed gentleman in the rear of\nthe room whose touch is far more forceful\ntran words. ~~ ;\n\nThe patron either sits down or leaves the\nparquette, : A\n\nThere is but one alternative.\n\nAfter three rounds have heen shown, dur-\nIng which the audience is thrown into a\nwild state of enthusiasm, the picture ma-\nchine stops suddenly and a young man\nabout 20 years old furnishes diversion by\nsinging a song through a megaphone,\n\n~ Just why this megaphone is used will\nprobably puzzle the visitor until he gets a d\ntrade secret from Gillesple,\n\nThe megaphone makes a loud sound, one\n| that can be heard in the street.\n| Nothing appeals =o strongly to the hobo\nas sentimental music. :\nHearing the notes from within, the man\non tha street enters the, saloon, then the\nparquette. and the chances are that, once\nseated, he will remain and in the course of\ntime will buy something.\n\nAdditional interest attaches to the songs\nbecause they are illustrated.\n\nGillesple manages the slidea, too. and\nwhen the final chorus is rendered the\nwords are thrown upon the canvas and tlie\naudience joins in the finale, thereby as-\nsisting the singer.\n\nThis makes more noise, even, than the\nmegaphone effect, and as a consequence\na greater number are induced to enter.\nPERFORMANCE OF CONTORTIONIST\nIS ANOTHER DIVERSION.\n\nAfter the song the fight pictures are re-\nnewed.\n\nGillespie repeats the rounds that were\nshown and after the exhilarating effect of\nthe song the hobos enjoy the fight even\nmore than they did formerly.\n\nA second diversion ia the performance of\nthe contortionist. , The contortionist is a\nhobo. . He was engaged that morning.\n\nHe arrived in town without money.\n\nHe needed some and negotiations between\nhim and the proprietor of ths Champion's\n‘Rest were quickly brought to a close. :\n\nAlthough the hobo realizes that a theater\nor a park job would be better. still he is\ndevoted to his art and he likes applause.\n\nLike all actors of high and low degree, he\noo a “hand.”\n\nhe knock-out round finally shown\nabout 11 o'clock. »\n\nEre that timé has arrived the hoboes have\nspent as much as their means will allow\nand enthusiasm in the Champion's Rest\nruns high.\n\nBy midnight things have' quieted 'a bit\nand by 1 o'clock many have departed, while\nothers remain in their chairs,\n\nA hobo is always welcome to & chair in\nthe Champions Rest.\n\nHe may not have room rent and if he\nhas not he always knows that a chair in\nthe parquet is at his disposal, even if he\nhas no money.\n\nIMPOVERISHED PATRONS\nAPPRECIATE PROPRIETOR'S FAVORS.\n\nThe wise proprieter knows that the hobo\nmay have money on the morrcw, and if he\nhas he will'spend it with the man who has\nbefriended him.\n\nThis is a characteristic of the tramp ele-\nment.\n\nOn some nights trade in the Champion's\nRest is good until 2 o'clock, but as a rule\nmost of the hoboes are asleep at this hour,\nand during the remaining hours of the\nion oe the night porter keeps a silent\nv\n\nProtection is afforded all patrons, and the\nman who sleeps in a chair feels reasonably\nassured that no one will steal his hat while\nhe slumbers, although there are frequenters\nwho will do it if the opportunity presents it-\nself. |\n\nThere are hoboes, too, who will rob thelr\nfellow-hobo.\n\nIt the sleeping hobo has a dime in his.\npocket he may wake up without it if the\nLi porter has proved derelict in his\nauty.\n\nShould the porter fall asleep the unfortu-\nnate hobo would quickly seize upon the val-\nuables of his more fortunate brother, and\nhe would show no hesitancy, for there have\nbeen times in his life, no doubt, when he\nhimself was “touched” for his all.\n\nIt is the alm, however, of Gillespie, to\neliminate crime from the Champion's Rest,\nand any man ‘caught in the act” is warn-\ned never to show his face in that place\nagain,\n\nAt four e'clock in the morning all is quiet\nin the Champion's Rest.\n\nEvery one i» asleep,and so silent is it that\ngue can almost -hear a pin drop in the saw-\n\nust.\n\nBhades of old Tom Allen are said to arise,\nand the {il-fated hobo may have dreams of\nthe day that is gone.\n\nIn his dream he may see old Tom at the\nplano, singing the love songs of a genera-\ntion ago. :\n\nThe pictures on the wall give evidence of\nthe victorious days of old Tom, and while\nthe hobo slumbers he sees many a cham-\nplonship battle fought again.\n\nThe dusty on cup, dro ie when\nhe won the heavy-w t championshi\nHEngland, and Se victors of the Batts of\nWaterloo, which hangs over the dar. lead\nadditional color to a scene that is and\ninteresting.

Sullivan.)\n(Copyright, 1910, by the Press Publisiing\nCompany, New York World.)\nCHAPTER XIIL\n| HERE has been so much talk and\n2% diversity of opinion as to whether\n\nI was ever the real champion of\nthe world that I feel it incumbent upon\nme to produce facts and figures to show\nthat I really earned that title. Fre-\nquently I see this question asked in the\nnewspapers and in many cases 1 seo\n\nthat the sporting editors answer that I\nnever war champion.\n\nTo etart with, Dr. Dudley A. Sargent\ndn his ‘Life and Reminiscences of a\n' Nineteenth Century Gladiator,” calls\nme the champion of the world, Enz-\nJand Is a part of the word ergo, @c-\ncording to Dr. Sargent, who is an\n, authority, I was champion of England.\n, Let us begin at the start. Tom Fig\n| was considered the first champion of\n| ¥ngland. He bloomed in 1719. The next\n| champion of note was Tom Cribb, who\n| received a championship belt that was\n' not transferable in 1819. The next cham-\n| plon was Tom Spring, who was cock of\nthe walk in 1820. Then comes Jim Ward,\n‘ who appeared five years later. In 1841\n. Caunt defeated Nick Ward for a belt\n| that was subscribed for. Four years\n| later Bendigo beat Caunt and got the\n| belt. In 1850 Perry, the Tipton Slasher,\n| after his draw with Paddock, claimed\n| the championship but never defeateA\n| the then champion, Bendigo. In 1853\n| Perry again claimed office because\n| Harry Broome forfeited a match with\n| him. Four years later, Tom Sayers beat\n| Perry for a new belt and $200 a side.\n\n; ‘When Heenan and Sayers were In the\nring an American put the heel of an\nold shoe into Heenan's hand, saying,\n\n“his is the heel of Yankee Sullivan's\nshoe, Jack; he swore he never lost a\n' fight while it was in the ring. Leaye it\nthere and go in and lick England!”\n\n\\ Open for Competition.\n\nLTHOUGH the heel did not prove\nA strong enough to get for Heenan\n\nthe English championship belt, it\nmust have discouraged Sayers, for he\nleft the belt open for competition. This\nwas the time when Jem Mace won it,\nconguering the giant, Sam Hurst, known\nas the ‘“Staleybridge Infant.” Tom Say-\ners and Heenan fought their memorable\nbattle in 18¢.. Chamber's Encyclopedia\nunder the head of boxing or pugilism,\nhas this to say of the Henan-Sayer’'s\nfight: “The year 1860, however, wit-\n\n“hessed a strange revival of the pugilistic\nsport on occasion of a fight between\n\nTom Sayers, the champion prizefighter\nof England, and John Heenan, the Ben-\n‘leea Boy, an American, for £200 a side,\nand the belt, a badge of honor won by\nthe champion. The battle, which was\n_ elevated to the dignity of a great in-\nternational contest by sporting papers,\ntook orm at Farnsborough, April 17,\n1860. It lasted for more than two hours,\n\n« In which time the American was beaten\n, almost blind and the Englishman dread-\nfully bruised. The continuance of the\nbattle was prevented by the breaking in\nof the ring, caused by the interference\n| of the police.”\nHomor for Champion.\n\nfre A FTER the battle the English\n: champion was ranked by\nmany newspapers, not sport-\n| ing ones, with the herves of the Crimea\n, and of Lucknow™ Hundreds, If indeed\nnot thousands, of pounds were sub-\n| scribed for him fn admiration of his\n| bravery by persons of all conditions\nof life and residing in all parts of the\ncountry, and he was feted by merchants\non the London and Liverpool ‘changes.\n| His opponent received equally flattering\nand substantial testimonials from Amer-\n| fcans. The fight formed the subject\n| of discussion in the House of Commons,\n| tn which the Home Secretary announced\nthat not only the principals but all pres-\n| ent at the spectacle were amenabl: to\n| the law. Though no steps were taken\n| to bring the offenders to Justice, it was\n| futimated to those chiefly concerned\nthat if a renewal of the fight were at-\n| tempted the law should be put in force\n\n| against those aiding-and abetting it.\"\n\nHere is one American account of the\nfight: “April 17, 1860, John Heenan\nfought Tom Sayers in England. Battle\nwas for £200 and the championship of\nEngland and America. Friends of Say-\ners, seeing the condition of their cham-\npion and fearing he would lose, cut the\nropes and the battle ended in a wran-\ngle. The stakes were drawn ang each\npugilist was presented with a champion-\n#=hip belt. The belt given to Heenan had\nnot been paid for, and he was obliged to\nreturn it.”\n\nMace te the Top.\n\nN 1861 Jem Mace beat Hurst In 1863\n\nTom King beat Mace and claimed\nthe belt, which he subsequently gave\nup, declining again to meet the RYDSY.\n\nMace again claimed the belt. In 186\nJem Mace and Joe Goss fought a draw\nfor $1000 u side and the belt. In 1869 Mec-\nCoole beat Tom Allen in this country\n\nfor the championship of the world. 1n\n\nNZ Jem Mace drew with Joe Coburn |\n\nhere for the championship of tie world.\n\nlu 1870 Jem Mace and Tom Allen fought\nfor the title and $5000 at Keanville, New\n\nOrleans, Mace won,\n\nTom Allen beat McCoole on Sept. 23,\n1873, at Chouteau Island, near gt. Louis,\n&nd on Nov. 18, same Vear, Ben Hogan\nfought Tom Allen for $200 and the\nchampionship of the Pacific coast. Allen\nWas winning when a wraagie hroke up\nthie fight. On Sept. 7 IST8, Joe Goss\nfought Allen for $2000 and the champion.\nship of \"tie world in Kentudky., Goss\nwas declared winner. The\" latter was\nbrought *over from England by Jem\nMace. On May 20, 1830. Joe Goss fought\nPaddy Ryan tot $1600 ang the eham-\nplonship, at Collier Station, W. Va. and\nnfter one hour and twenty-seven minutes\nof hard fighting Ryan won.\n\nIn commenting on the fight the 5\nsas City Times said: ‘'Sullivan Knocskea\nJoe Goss out in four and one-half\nminutes on Feb, 7, 1880, while it took\nRyan one hour and 27 minutes to do the\nsame thing to the foreign champion.”\n\nPolice Save Mitchell.\nY victory over Slade of Austra-\n\nM lia (the Maori) brought here by\n\nJem Mace, is a matter of his-\ntory, as is the slaughter of Chariey\nMitchell in Madison Square Garden,\nWhen T begged Capt.

They were kept in neglected\nsheds and basements, were of the\nvilest kind and the army of “Heine-\ngabublers” drank, ate and slept on the\nfloors and tables\n\nThe “Heinegabubler” saloons were\nequipped with trapdoors, sliding stair-\nways, chairs with legs broken and all\nsorts of contrivances which were in-\nstalled for the amusement of the B\nguests of the resort and to be used\nfn case of a raid by the police.\n\nIt was known that the “Hieneza-\nbublers” were consumers of the vilest\nconcoctions of the bad whisky men.\nIt was proven that more than one\ndegenerate was the subject of an in- -\nsurance policy. the beneficiary of\nwhich was the man who made and\ndispensed the liquor he drank.\n\nHeinegabublers held their carousals §¥\nin St. Louis for many years. Finaily *\nthey were all closed up and the man\nwho ran them disappeared. They were\nthe very worst dives St. Louis has\never known.\n\nTom Allen's saloon at Seventh and\nMarket streets, where the American [\nTheater now stands, was another place |\nthat dragged scores of men to the gut- |\nter through the medium of “doped”\nliquor. In those days saloons remained\nopen all night and the men slept in\nthe barroom. huddled on chairs\nbenches and on the floor. Tom Allen's\nsaloon consisted of one big barroom\nin a tumble-down frame building over\nwhich the proprietor lived. The walls\nwere decorated with signs of both a\nsacrilegious and immoral character.\nOn the front window was posted this\nsignificant sign, “We are lower than\nthe lowest.”\n\nIn the dingy room of Tom Allen's\njoint as many as 200 men slept on\ncold nights. These men ranged from |\n18 to 65 vears of age. Some of them §\nwere men who had fallen into the §\nclutches of the saloonkeeper at an\nearly age. |.\n\nThe story of a man by the name S\nof Knight illustrates this. Knight\nwas arrested for a minor offense by\nthe St. Louis police in the hey-day of\nTom Allen's activities. He told a\nstory that sent a chill of horror over\n‘the city. People did not know such\nthings existed outside of fiction.\n\nKnight said that he staggered into\na certain dive and asked for a drink.\nHe was about 50 years old at this\ntime, had been a drinking man for\ntwenty years and he was then in a\nstate of almost starvation. The sa-\nloonkeeper looked him over, sized him\nup and said: \\\n\n“I think I'll take a chance on you.\nI'll give vou $100 cash, all the whisky\n¥ou ean drink and a place to sleep If\nyou let me take out an insurance pol-\nicy on your life.”\n\nKnight acceded and after sobering )\nup, he was insured for $1,400. He\nwas then fed on bad whisky for\nmonths. As fast as he got sober the\nsaloonkeeper passed more liquor over 7\nto him. This was kept up until he\nalmost died from the effects of the j\ndrugs. Knight finally left the saloon- ;\nkeeper, sobered up and ‘‘got on his\nfeet” again. The latter lost the $100\ncash and the whisky. But there are\nhundreds of these men who do not |\nrise like Knight did. \\\n\nHOMES LAID WASTE.\n\nThere are said to be as many of\nthese dives in St. Louis today as\nthere has ever been in the past.\n\nOne local organization which now\nopenly advertises its rotten product,\noperates six or even saloons in the\ncity. Its patrons number 1,000 men,\n50 per cent of whom have one foot\nin the grave. It is declared by cer-\ntain mission workers of St. Louis that\nthey know of several actual cases\nwhere saloon people are giving whisky |\naway free to the men who frequent\ntheir resorts. This is said to be con-\nvincing that these same saloonkeepers\nmust find some profit in return for\ntheir beneficence. One man recently\ninformed Rev. Edward Card of the St\nLouis City Mission that he peszitively\nknew that a certain St Louis saloon-\nkeeper holds a policy on his life for\n21.500. He gets his whisky free from\nthis man.\n\nThis whisky may be left to the im-\nagination of the reader. Each mixer\nis said to have his own formulas,\n- which he keep® secret. Thess ars\ndeadly more or less, accordinz to the\nnerve of the man who mixes them.\n\nA case recently exposed brought to\nlight the fact that this so-called “bad\nliquor’ sldom contains more than\n10 per « real whisky.\n\n© Anothe uantity secured by a St.\nLouis mar. »wed enough cocaine to\nalmost kilt = man who drinks it.\nOthers have 2en found to contain\nmorphine, strychnine; the percentage\nof alcohol has been found to be in\ncertain cases so great as to have the\nsame effect as the pure drug.\n\nEvidence has shown that for the\nmost part the dive keepers who sell\nthis bad whisky mix it in the cellar\nof the resort. “A man who knows all\nthe ins and outs of the most vile place\nin St. Louis,” said Mr. Card, “said he\nhad seen the woman who owns the\nsaloon and a man helper, upstairs\nmixing the terrible eoncoction that is\n\n. sold over the bar, and what they were\n- putting in it one can only surmise.\n4 “I have been told, upon good au-\n\"thority, that in these dives where\n: death’s policy game is being played,\n: ‘whisky’ is on tap and the men help\n- themselves. A key is placed in one\n{ end of the room and glasses are every-\n* where at hand. In case a charge is\n* made the lump sum paid permits the\n. patron to drink all he cares to. The\n. saloonkeeper knows that he can’t go\n\\ very far before the drugs ‘get him.”\n. LOOKS LIKE WHISKY.\n\nFrom all outward appearances, this\n= had whisky looks like the real thing.\n\nCaromel coloring is used to give it the\n\nproper shade. It is Invariably the\n\nproduct of the retailer. One might\nask why the United States Govern-\n! ment does not go after these moon-\n* shiners, but the Revenue Department\nhas nothing to do with the retailer so\nlong as he does not infringe upon\ntheir particular rules. The Revenue\n\nDepartment closely watches the dis-\n= tiller and the rectifier. Many large\n\nwhisky concerns whose reputation is\n\nundoubted rectify whisky, but they\n| must comply with the laws. A gauger\n\n“from the revenue office is on hand\n\nwhen this rectifying is being done and\n\nhis stamp must be upon the keg or\nbarrel to show the same. He sees that\nthere are no foreign or injurious ma-\nterials put in the whisky and that it is\ndone right. Rectifying is little more\nthan blending of various grades, which\nis entirely in compliance with the law.\n\nBeyond the rectifier and the dis-\ntiller the revenue office appears to\nhave little jurisdiction. This leaves\n© the dive keeper almost free range to\ndo as he pleases with the product he\nI sells.\n\nThe lives of the men who have\n10st beyond belief, A man who was\nnce wealthy in New York City en-\n\nered the City Mission recently and\nold of his life for the past ten years.\n\n- “I have slept by day In a saloon\nellar,” he said, “and have spent my\nsights consuming bad whisky\n\nI The effect of this poison u the\nsuman body must be seen to ‘real-\nted.

Heenan for\nthe world's championship will be told.\nMACE FOR $10,000\n\n| PART L |\nBY BILLY MURPHY.\n\n“Tom Allen, who for years was &\nresident of St. Louis, was one of nnd]\ngreatest fighters the world has ever\nknown,” reminisced Prof. Bill Clark, |\nvesterday, while we were sp\nfamous fights.\n\n“Allen's battle for $10,000 and the\nchampionship of the world with Jem |\nMace, England's great fighter,” was a |\nferocious one. |\n| “The men signed to mix, January\n117, 1870. They met the May 10, fol-\n{ lowing, within ten miles of the city!\n| of New Orleans. Of course this bat-\ntle was fought under the London\n| Prine Ring Rules on the turf, which\n| permitted hugging and wrestling, the\nbare knuckles being used.\n\nSPORTSMEN ASSEMBLE. =\n| “On the afternoon of May 9, 1870,\n| the St. Charles Hotel in the Crescent\n| City was crowded with sportsmen\n4 all parts of America, who had\n| come to see the great battle. Betting\n[vas fast and furious till Allen's back-\n| ers stood out for such long odds that\nthe other side refused to give. Both\n| neraes were present, and each was\n{the center of an admiring crowd.\n| Mace was accompanied by his cousin,\na Pooley Mace, and his trainer, Jem\nCusick, who had trained and seconded\nJohn C. Heenan, the “Benecia Boy.\nfor his great fight with Tom Sayers,\nthe English champion, years before.\n\n“Jem had commenced his training\nat Mobile Bay, but, to escape the at-\ntentions of the sheriff, he had moved\n\n| to Magnolia, in Alabama, and had\n| finally taken his breathings on the\n| old Metairie race track, on the out-\nskirts of New Orleans, the scene of\nthe great contest between those two\nmighty heroes of the turf, Lexington\nand Lecompte, whose rivalry was as\nfamous as that between Hermis and\n\n|\n\n| Colonial Girl, World's Fair vear. orf\n\nwas at that old track that Lexington\n\nperformed his memorable feat of cov- |\n\nering four miles in 7 minutes and 19 |\nseconds.\n\nPRAISE FOR MACE. |\n\n“Everyone was full of praise of |\nJem’'s condition,” rambled on grand |\nold Bill. “At the St. Charles Hotel |\n\nbeautiful Creole girls and handsome |\nwhite wemen pressed forward, eager |\n|to be introduced to the good-looking |\n| Englishman, and they kept poor Jem’s |\n\"heart in a flutter, as he told me after- j\n| wards. Jem never in his life had |\nsuch an enthusiastic receptioz, and |\n| he commented on the warmth of sym- |\npathy and geniality of the Southern- |\n| ers. :\n| “Tom Allen, attracted comparative- |\n[ly little attention. It was Mace, the |\n| most scientific boxer in the world: ,\n| Mace, the hero of a score of fights: |\n| Mace, the champion of Great Britain, |\nthat men and women were eager SS\n| see and to shake hands with. Allen, }\n| Who had trained right here in St. |\n| Louis, under Jack Goulding and Joe\n| Coburn, had of course plenty of at- |\ntention from his backers, and the la- |\n{dies condescended just to cast one |\n| curious glance at him to hundreds for:\n| the champion. !\n\n“It was a case of early to bed that!\nnight for all of us, for the start for\n\n| the ground was to take place\nfrom the Jackson Railway depot at\n4 o'clock the next morning; and, as a\n| matter of fact, many prominent citi- |\n| zens, merchants, lawyers, physicians, |\n| ex-officers of both the Federal and!\nConfederate armies, from the grade of |\ngeneral down to lieutenant, were at\nthe rendezvous by 3:30 a. m., thougn\nit was 5 o'clock before the specially-\nchartered train moved out of the sta-\ntion.\nPOLICE PRECAUTIONS S\n\n“The municipal authorities would |\nnot alow the fight to take place anye\nwhere within their immediate juris-\ndiction, but they dispatched seventy\n| policemen to see the special safe out\n; of the station. The train was halted\nabout # quarter of a mile from the\n} depot, and then boarded by the police,\n| who ejected every person who was\n| unable to produce a ticket, and thus |\n| the rowdy element was effectually ex-\n§ nn The combatants and their\nseconds were not in the special itself,\nt but followed behind in what was then\n{called a “dummy’”—that is a loco-\n, motive and passenger car combined\n{in one, the former being fitted with |\n| condensing engines to avoid the noise\nor escaping steam.\n\nAbout eight miles from New Or-\nleans, at a place called Kennerville,\nthe train disgorged its freight. The\ntwenty-four foot ring was quickly set\nup, and the spectators, some 1,000 or\n1,500 in number, quietly ranged them-\n| selves round it. A more orderly |\n| price: never assembled to witness a |\nprize-fizht, which was no doubt due\nto the fact that quite three-fourths |\n{ of those present were what the Cres- |\ncent City papers called “men of cul-\nTok The Chicago Baseball Club\ni had come en masse to see the sport\n| and there were few sporting societies\nin America and even Canada which\nwere not represented.\n\nALL KINDS OF MEN.\n\n“The Louisiana Jockey Club, which\nhad its headquarters in New Orleans,\nhad turned out in full strength to do |\nhonor to the occasion, and not since |\nthe great fight between Heenan ant)\nSayers, had such an assembly graced\nthe ringside. The men were of all |\nnationalities there; Creole dandies, |\n| glossy-coated and patent-leather boot-\nfed; broad-shouldered planters, in suits\nof white nankeen; smartly-togged\nsports from New York; backwoods-\nmen in homespun—any variety of cos-\ntumes in fact.\n\n“Loud cheers greeted both men as |\nthey stepped on the smooth green-\nsward, attended by their seconds, Jem |\nCusick and Pooley Mace for the Eng-\nlishman: Joe Coburn, whom I boxed |\nat the Natatorium twenty vears ago,\nand Thurston for Tom Allen. There\nhad been a good deal of shaking of |\n{ the head among us old-timers, who |\n1 believed in the old adage, “Youth will |\nbe served,” at Mace's rashness in tak- |\nI on a man so much younger than\nhimself. For Allen was but 27. ana\nthirteen vears is a lot to give away. |\n\n“But they forgot that Jem Mace\nhad been notoriously careful of him-\nself. Indeed, I don't know of any\npugilist with maybe the exception of\nJem Ward, who took better care of\n\n‘| himself than Jem Mace, and, like\n\nWard, he, in consequence, preserved\nhis health 2=4 vigor in a surprising\ni manner. Jem’'s condition that day\nwas perfect.\n\nIN PERFECT SHAPE.\n\n“He was as hard as nails, though\nhe scaled 168 pounds, which was ten\npounds more than his fighting weight\nin England. You may think that was\nlight for a heavyweight, but I have\nalways maintained that a 165-pound\nman is not handicapped against the\nheaviest fighter in the world, if the\n{ 165-pounder has courage, skill and\n| strength. We have instances that\nsupport my theory in Mace, Mitchell\nFitzsimmons and McCoy. Any of\nthese men would have beaten to\ndeath the man Jack Johnson won\n\n{from at Reno, July 4, 1910. f\n\n“Tom Allen. that no*able May day\nweighed 175 pounds. He appeared\n| ruddy and well, but there was too\n\n.{ much flesh about his face. My recol-\nlection of Tom is that he was rather\nlight and thin about the shoulders\n\n{and back that day, but with good\n\n| loins and first-rate pedestals. He was\n\n: like as muscular or well-\n| champion. but he had the advantage\nlof an inch in height. Mace, though\n| was much the older man, bu he\n| moved with all the suppleness of a\npanther, and was clearly the more\nagile of the two.\n\n.{ (To Be Continued in Sunday's Star,\n\n{| January 28.)\n\n' Set a6 Neg",

    text: "HOW AN IRISHMAN\ni\nFOR UNITED STATES\ni\nre em SE LHS SR |\n: - BY BILLY MURPHY. !\nThe writer was a guest of Professor Bill Clark, the Beifast Chicken,\nSunday afternoon. It had occurred to me, that it would prove interesting\nreading St. Patrick's Day, if TI could present to the readers of The New Star\nan authentic story of how the world's ring championship came to America.\nI had never seen such an article and knew that the beloved “Belfast Chicken”!\ncould tell me. Tn fact, I believe he is the only man in the world today, who |\nis acquainted with the true story of the retrogression of the Britisay fighters!\nand the rise of Americans, :\nHere is old Bill's story, which I report as accurately as it is possible for !\nme to do. “The Chicken” talked in this manner: ’\n“That grand old institution, the prize ring, which has an ineradicable |\ncharm for all men, attained the height of its popularity in the vear 1860, when |\nthat gallant little champion, Tom Sayers, after a struggle with John Camel!\nHeenan, the American champion, which may be truly described as stupendous, |\nretired from active work, and left the old Champion Belt open for compe- |\ntition. The troubles of the prize ring then commenced. In turn the trophy |\nwas won by Sam Hurst, the giant from Stalybridge, Jem Mace, Tom King,\nJoe Wormald, Mace again, and finally, after a number of scenes not of a |\nvery creditable nature, the police made matters so hot that a number of |\nprominent pugilists determined to try their luck in America. Just prior to!\ntheir departure, however, Joe Goss. the English champion, and Tom Allen |\nsigned articles to fight for the premier honor.\n“That intended battle really put an end to the sport in England, for both |\nmen were arrested on the eve of the fight upon bench warrants, and from |\nthe activity and earnestness shown in the matter the pugilists realized that |\nit was all over with their vocation for a time.\nOFF TO AMERICA.\n“Among the foremost arrivals in the land of the Stars and Stripes were |\nJoe Wormald, O'Baldwin, Bob Prettle, Bill Ryall, Jem Mace, Joe Goss, and |\nTom Allen. Only the doings of the two last-named, however, need claim our!\npresent attention. At that time (1867) Tom Allen was at his very best, and |\nwas a splendid specimen of an athlete, fully 5 feet 10 inches, and about 164\npounds. He could hold his own in any company, and soon after his arrival in |\nAmerica he made a match with Mike McCoole, a man almost big enough to\neat him, and he was fast making mince meat of Michael when the latter's |\nfriends opened on him with ball cartridge, and stopped proceedings. At that]\ntime ring fights were conducted on very free and easy lines in America, pistols!\nand knives playing a very prominent and lively part in the proceedings, while |\nin some of the encounters the men themselves fought on the “all in\" prin-!\n¢iple, and half the battle was frequently fought with both men on the ground. |\nBARKERS AND BOWIES, |\n“With the introduction of the British brigade, however, things mended |\nsomewhat, and when, after the departure of Mace and Co. Goss and Tom\nAllen were once more matched for the championship—not of England, bear |\nin mind, but for that of the world this time-—a fairly decent display was\ngiven. The men, of course, fought under the recognized London Prize Ring |\nRules, and all would have gone well but for a gang of ruffians who had |\nbacked Goss somewhat heavily, and when the latter was seen to be getting\nthe worst of it they presented a few barkersand bowies to the notice of the !\nreferee, and that worthy was induced to give his decision in favor of the man |\nwho would in all probability have lost if the fight had been allowed to proceed. |\n~ PADDY RYAN. |\n“While the British brigade were reaping a golden harvest by fighting\n. among themselves and giving exhibitions of the noble art, there arose a young !\nIrish-American from the city of Troy. who laid claim to the title of cnampion,\nHe fought and defeated a number of local men, and challenged Joe Goss to\nfight for the championship. There was a tremendous amount of enthusiasm |\nover the event; in fact. so much was made of it that the Attorney-General]\nof Ontario, where the fight was advertised to take place, ordered out three |\ncompanies of the Third Battalion of Infantry to arrest the disturbers of the\npeace. As a consequence the meeting between the men had to be postponed, |\nand finally, after being hunted about from place to place, the men fought on\nthe border line between West Virginia and Pennsylvania, where a terrific\nencounter was put up. However, Ryan, the younger and stronger man,\neventually compelled his antagonist to give in, after fighting nearly an hour |\nand a half. |\nTHE GENESIS OF GLOVE FIGHTING.\n: “After the Goss and Ryan battle, the authorities bestirred themselves, |\nand issued a warrant for the arrest of both men, but they managed to es-\ncape to Canada, where they had to hide until the matter was settled. a\nlegal business was rather a lengthy job, and by the time it was finished and\nRyan had returned to New York he found that a new star had come to the |\nfront. This was a young Bostonian, John Lawrence Sullivan by name, bsg\nhad been creating quite a sensation by the marvelous manner in which he |\nput his opponents to sleep with the gloves. Sullivan challenged Ryan to\nfight with these weapons, but the latter replied that as he had won the cham-\nplonship from Goss by a fight with nature's weapons the Boston glove-slinge: |\nwould have to meet him under like conditions. A tremendous amount of time i\nwas wasted in discussing the terms of the meeting, but at length Sullivan had |\nto give way, and the pair signed articles to fight under London Prize Ring |\nRules for the championship of the world and $5,000 a side.\nSULLIVAN WINS THE CHAMPIONSHIP.\n“The men met at Mississippi Cityon February 7, 1882, and a truly hurri-|\ncane fight was put up. |\n“From the first round it was practically “all over,” for Ryan was help- |\nless in the hands of the sturdy Bostonian. Sullivan simply overwhelmed and |\noutpunched his plucky opponent, and eventually won the fight with ridiculous :\nease in the short time of eleven and a half minutes. And that is how the\nchampionship went to America. : {\n“Mace who had the best right to the English title had drawn with Joe |\nCoburn. Goss beat Coburn. Goss also drew with Mace. There was no ||\ndoubt whatever that Goss was esteemed the best man in Great Britain. |\n3 “England has tried many times to wrest back the championship under\nLondon Prize Ring and Marquis of Queensberry rules, but has never been able |\nto do so. {\n| “Charley Mitchell made the best attempt of all the contenders when he!\nfought Sullivan thirty-nine rounds to a draw decision on the estate of the |\nBaron Rothschilds at Chantilly, France. But the English champion ran!\naway from Sullivan all through the fight. A draw was his alm and he got it. I:\n“Even then, Sullivan was slipping back. He had been feted and dined  ;\nin England like a god. Jack Ashton and Sullivan sparred before the Prince |’\nof Wales and Sullivan met the queen at a special reception, :\n“At 24, the ring never saw the like of Sullivan,” concluded the Professor,\n“he would have beaten men like Johnson in a punch.” Hi\nERNIE. _____AAANRRERRRRNRRRm_hee_— F",

CORBETT.\n\nThe name of Tom Allen figures |.\nconspicuously in ring history of a!\nlong gone era. Allen, after a num- |.\nber of years of activity in English |\nrings, came to St. Louis, and for near- |\nily ten years afterward he was some- |’\nthing of an \"on-again-off-again” king\nof American heavies.\n\nBirmingham, England, was Allen's |\nbirthplace, Bern in 1840, hé battied |\nfor the first time in a prize ring |\nagainst a man named Waggner, in\n1861, in Birmingham. The bout was |\nfor a side bet of $25 and Allen |\nemerged a victor. That triumph en-\ncouraged him to make a match with |\na feilow named Gould for a stake of\n$200—and once again Allen won. |\n\nThose achievements determined |\nhim upon a career as a professional |\n\n| ringman. He sought a bout with |\n| Posh Price—and was whipped in Af- |\n| ty-five minutes. That was in 1862.\n| Undiscouraged, Allen fought Bingley |\nRose. in Nottingham, England, for\n$250, and pounded his way to vie- |\ntory in twenty-nine minutes. 21\nJune, 1864, he waged his next right\nagainst Bob Smith, a Liverpool negro\nFw Allen got the surprise of his\n\ne.\n\nThe Birmingham youngster expect-\ned an easy victory. The most he |’\ncould get Smith to fight for was $50\n\n!a side. Figuring that Smith was\n‘easy money,’ Allen bet heavily on\nhimself, with the ringside crowd giv-\ning big odds.

Soon\nafterward Allen coaxed Price, his |\n| early conqueror, into giving him a |\nreturn bout for a side bet of $125.\nAllen, spurred on by an intense ha-\ntred for Price, fought one of the most\nmerciless fights of his lifetime, final-\nly forcing Price to guit in the fourth\nround, after two hours and five min- |\n| utes of warfare.\n\nOn June 12, 18686, Allen whipped\nGeorge lles, which put him in line\nfor a battle with Joe Goss. The two\nmet for the championship of England\non March 5, 1867, for a side bet of\n$500.

After\n{ several ineffectual cfforts to get an- |\nother chance at Goss, and unable to |\nget any of the second raters in En- |\ngland to try conclusions with him,\nAllen decided, in 1867, to visit the |\nUnited States.\n\nAllen's first appearance before n |\nprize ring audience in this country |\nwas not as a fighter, but as a second |\n—and hig conduct created a sensa- |\ntion. 4 |\n\nJust about the time that Allen ar-\nrived In the United States a match\nwas made between Tom Kelly, an old\nSt. Louis fighter, and Bill Parkinson\nof Pottsville, Pa. The battle, which\nwas for a side bet of $1,000, was put\non in Acquia Creek, Vt, and stands\nout as one of the most deplorable in\nthe early history of -the pugilistic\ngame.\n\nThe backers of Kelly figured (it\nwould be a great boost for their\nman te secure Allen to second the\nBaltimore fighter. Allen consented\n—and went even farther. He agreed\nto assist the Baltimore gang finan-\ncially interested in Kelly, to sce to\nit that Kelly did not lose the fight.\n\nTries to Bluff Referce.\n\nSoon after the fight started and It\nbecame apparent that Parkinson was\nKelly's master, Allen whipped out a\nhuge revolver, and, pointing it at\nWm. E. Harding, a New York sport\nwriter, who offlciated as referee, de-\nclared:\n\n“If Kelly doesn't win this fight\nyou'll get shot.”\n\nAllen's action was the.cue for the\nBaltimore crowd to flourish guns in\nan effort to frighten Harding. But\nthe courageous referee, looking\nsquarely at Allen, declared:\n\n“T'll decide this fight strictly on its\nmerits. If you don’t like my way of\ndoing things shoot any time you're\nready. And that goes for Kelly's\ngang of cutthroats out here” and\nHarding pointed out at the ugly and\narmed cfowd.\n\nHarding's coolness and gameness |\nreally cowed the crowd—and Allen\ntoo. After a time they put thelr re-\nvolvers back into thelr pockets. But\nas the fight went on, it became an ab-\nsolute certainty that if it wasn't\nstopped Kelly would be beaten into\nn'neonsciousness. In this emergency\nKelly's backers appealed to Allen to\n‘do something.” There was but one\nthing to do—and Allen did it.\n\nAllen Cuts the Ropes.

Matches ot any 1im-\nportance were slow in the making\nand. because they were all fights to\na finish, there were long periods of |\ntraining. In addition, the fighters |\nhad either to cack themselves or\nfind someone who was willing to\nrisk fortunc upon their chances\nThis was not always easy to do, and\nwhen # “backer” was found he In- |\nvariably insisted that his fighter get\nin the best possible condition before\nhe would let him fight.\n\nThere was generally considerable\nwrangling before signing the “arti-\ncles of agreement.” it being an ad- |\nage of the ring that “a match well !\nmade is half won.” Most of the ar-\ngument concerned where the men\nwould fight, when, and for how\nrruch. It was taken tor granted\nthat the fight would be to a finish\nand there was no trouble coming\nto an understanding that the fight\nwould be with small gloves, skin-\ntight gloves, or bare knuckles. These\ntights were nearly all governed by\nthe Marquis Jf Queensberry rules\n\nthere being only a few fights in the\nvicinity of St. Louis under the Lon-\ndon Prize Ring rules following the\ndefeat of Mike McCoole by Tom\nAllen in 1873.\n\nPrize-Fighting a Felony.\n\nThe fight betwz2en Allen and Mc-\nCoole had taken place cn Chouteau\nIsland (nicknamed “Bloody” Island\nby fight followers). in the river a\nshort distance above St. Louis. This\nfight so outraged the citizens of St.\nLouis that in the following Janu-\nary the Missouri Legislature passed\na statute making prize-fighting a\nfelony and even declared giving an\nexhibition of boxing in public a mis-\n¢emeanor\n\nThis probably accounts for the\nfact that there was little prize-\nfighting or boxing in St, Louis from\nthat time until about the middle\n80's. It seems to have started again\nabout the time of Tom Allen's re-\nturn to St. Louis, after having failed\nto secure a match with Join L. Sul-\nivan for the championship of the\nworld.\n\nAllen had returned © London\nEngland, following his victory over\nMcCoole and in the meantime Sul-\nlivan came into prominence. Rich-\nard K. Fox, publisher of the Police\nGazette, a publication given over to\nsporting and theatrical events, con-\nceived a violent dislike for Sullivan\nand vowed he would find a man io\npeat him\n\nFox sent for Allen and arranged\nan exhibition with Joe Goss, whom\nAllen had previously defeated. This\nexhibition took place in Madison\nSquare Garden in New York City\nand Allen made such a miserable\nsnowing that Fox dismissed the idea\nof his fighting Sullivan\nAllen Operates “Champion's Rest.”\n\nAllen came on to St. Louis in 1884\nand engaged in the saloon business\ncalling his place the “Champion's\nRest.” It was located at the north-\neast corner of Seventh and Market\nstreets and soon became a popular\nresort for followers of pugilism.

    text: "Bare knuckle\nboxi\nxing: On\noxing:\n3\nt ived\nBy ROBERT L. BURNES\nExecutive Sports Editor :\n\nIt will be 100 years to the day next May 22 that Tom Al-\nlen, almost the last of the bare knuckle boxing champions,\nenjoyed the greatest moment of his life.\n\nHe was no longer the champion, having lost the title to\nJoe Goss on an island near Covington, Ky., on Sept. 7, 1876.\nAllen was disqualified for committing a foul in the 2Ist *\nround and it must have been a flagrant violation because in\nthose days gouging, kneeing, heeling, kicking and tripping\nwere established niceties of the sport.\n\nTwo years later he returned to his native England and on\nMay 22, 1878, appropriate ceremonies to honor him took\nplace. J :\n\nHe was presented a huge silver cup on which were in-\nscribed the words “Presented To Tom Allen, Champion\nBoxer of England, by his buddies and admirers as a token of\ntheir admiration of his skill and science, May 22, 1878, at the\nCambridge Hall, Newman St., and Oxford St., London,\nEngland.”\n\n| That cup today holds a place of hoor in the home\nof his great grandson, Thomas Allen Taylor, chairman of\nthe board of Seven Up Bottling Co.\n\n“My father retrieved this cup from a pawn shop on Mar-\nket Street in 1938,” Tom Taylor said, ‘but I have no idea.\nwhere it was from the time Tom Allen died just past the\"\nturn of the gentury until my dad foutid it.” Jassili\n\nThe cup is the sole remaining tangible reward of the.\ncareer of Tom Allen, St. Louis saloon keeper. If some of the..\nepisodes have a ring familiar to what you read about boxing”\ntoday, it is ample evidence that the game hasn’t changed\nmuch except to put gloves on the combatants.\n\nAllen’s saloon was called Sportsmen’s Rest and was lo-\ncated on Market Street, between 6th and 7th, where the old\n\n-~ American Theater once stood. The site today is a parking lot\n\"just west of Kiener Plaza.\n\nBy Tom Allen’s frank admission, Sportsmen’s Rest was a\nsaloon, nothing more, a rugged drinking place for fur trad-\nars, for river men and for anyone else who wandered in.\n\nWhenever an argument broke out up front and could not\nsettled with words, the principals retired to the back room,\naccompanied by anybody who happened to be in the place\nand settled the difference with their bare hands. It was a\ndangerous procedure because boxing or fighting was strictly\nagainst the law. If someone in the place ran out on to Mar-\nket Street yelling “fight,” the police would move in, arrest\nthe principals and haul them off to the constabulary where :\nheavy fines were assessed. ¥\n\nBecause St. Louis is hard by the Mississippi,\nthe area was the hub of bare knuckle fighting in the ’60s and\n*70s. If the fighters really meant business, they and friends\nwould hire a boat and everybody would go out to one of the\nmany islands in the Mississippi. AREA SR PERN\n\nWhen they arrived, the spectators would form a ring...\naround the fighters (which is why the squared fight area of\ntoday is still called a ring), some planks would be laid on the\nground. The fighters, their seconds and the spectators would\nthen put up the money for which the combatants would con-\ntest on a winner-take-all basis.\n\nThere was one further bit of formal ceremony. Each\nfighter would stand in the crowd until the challenger took off\nhis cap or hat and tossed it into the ring. That expression\n“throwing his hat in the ring,” still exists.\n\nMost of the onlookers would crowd around the fighters\n\n~ “but a few had a special assignment. They would clamber\ninto trees, not only because they could have a better view of\nthe proceedings but they could also keep a wary eye out for\npolice who might have been alerted and were en route\nacross the water to break up the brawl. :\nThis particular bare knuckle era started in\n1865. John Heenan had been the champion, had been inac-\ntive for several years. Assuming that Heenan had retired,\nJoe Coburn fought Bill McCoole in Cumberland, Md. in 1863\nand Coburn won on a knockout in the 63rd round.\n\nTwo years later Coburn announced his retirement and\nMcCoole claimed the title. In 1869, Allen reinforced his\nclaim to No. 1 challenger by finishing off Bill Davis in 43\nrounds on Chouteau Island and issued a challenge to\nMcCoole.\n\nMcCoole, a huge Irishman who outweighed Tom by-as\nmany as 45 pounds, and Allen did not like each other. It was\nmore than a challenge for boxing supremacy. They had vio-\nlent arguments whenever they met. On some occasions they\ncame to blows with i) vith at stake. Alllen accused\nMcCoole of ducking him. :\n\nFinally McCoole agreed to put his claim to the title on the .\nline and he and Allen met on Carpenter’s Island on June 15,\n1869. News stories said Allen was winning fair and squareg\nwhen the bout was stopped. The next night, on the stage of a\n\ntheater, the referee announced that McCoolg'had retained\nhis title, that Allen had been disqualified for a foul.\n\nLater the referee was to amend his story, say that he had 3\nbeen intimidated into declaring McCoole the winner. Appar-\nently more than the normal amount of money was bet on the\nfight, estimates going as high as $25,000. Professional gam-\nblers were betting on McCoole. When they saw things going\n\n\"badly for their fighter, they swarmed the ring, assaulted the\n~ referee and brought the fight to an end in a bloody brawl.\n\nThe whole thing was not a total loss for Allen. He\nhad the liquor concession.\n\n“Whenever ‘we arranged a fight on one of the islands,” he\ns%id, “I'd take care of the whiskey. For that first fight with E\n\n- McCoole, we must have had 1,400 or 1,500 men assembled ¥\nand they all came to drink and watch the fight.”\n~ Four years intervened before Allen got another shot at\n- McCoole.\ni A year later, the famed Jem Mace came into the picture,\ntook on Allen at Kennersville, La., won on a 10th-round\nknockout. (Rounds ended in those days when one fighter\nwas knocked down...if he could not continue the bout was\nover.) Mace claimed the heavyweight title. One of those to\ncontest his claim was an aging Joe Coburn who came out of\nretirement. :\nMace and Coburn fought twice in 1871 without conclusive\nresult. The first was stopped by police. On the second occa- .\nsion, they fought 12 rounds...then suddenly quit and walked\nout of the ring without explanation. (It was later said that\ntheir seconds told them that the gambler holding the side\nbets had absconded with the money. Since there was no\npoint in continuing, they quit.) -\n\nMace and Coburn ceased their ring activities with that\nunsatisfactory performance and that left the field once more\nto those old rivals, Allen and McCoole. Cia\n\nAfter many threats and challenges, they agreedon\na rematch on Sept. 23, 1871, on Chouteau’s Island. Allen beat\nMcCoole into a bloody pulp in three or four rounds, at the\nend of which time McCoole’s seconds wanted to call it off.\nHe refused and took a savage pounding from Allen until he\ncollapsed into a heap in the eleventh round and that ended\nit.\n\nAllen’s claim to the title was without dispute then until he\nlost on the foul to Joe Goss. After that Allen took leave of his\nsaloon briefly to return to his native England where in 1878\nhe received the coveted cup.\n\nHe returrfed to Sportsmen’s Rest which he continued to\noperate until he died on April 6, 1903.\n\nHe was living evidence of why the rules had to be amend-\ned. He had paid a terrible physical price. His face was lined :\nwith scars. He had another terrible scar on his right hand.\nIn a fight with one Charley Gallagher, someone fired a shot\nand the ball struck Allen’s hand. A dcotor examined it, pried\"\nthe bullet loose, swabbed the hand and ordered the fight to\ngo on. “It didn’t hit the nuscle,” Allen said, “so I just kept\non fighting and won.”\n\nThe most obvious — and gruesome — evidence of the toll\nthe fights took were Allen’s hands. Pictures of him in later\n\n9 years showed his hands to be shapeless hunks, the knuckles\ngone, eroded by the constant pounding they not only inflict-\ned but absorbed. 4\n\nWe would like to finish a story which\n\nbegan on the special sports page in the\nweekend edition of The Globe-Democrat.\nBecause of space problems, the finishing\ntouches to the life of Tom Allen, one of\nthe last of the bare-knuckle heavyweight\nchampions of the world, were left un-\ntold.\n\nHe had been a saloon keeper in St.\nLouis, had operated the Sportsmen's\nRest at Sixth and Market, had defeated\nBill McCoole for the championship on\n\n Chouteau Island in the Mississippi in\nSeptember of 1871. He defended against\nall comers until 1876 when he lost the\ntitle on a foul to Joe Goss. Two years\nlater he returned to his native England\nfor a visit, was presented with a huge\nsilver cup by his friends and admirers.\nThat happened exactly 100 years ago on\nnext May 22.\n\nAllen lost interest in boxing when the\nMarquis of Queensberry, appalled by\nthe bloody carnage he had witnessed in\nthe bare knuckle brawls, refined the\nrules of the game. Fighters wore skin-\ntight gloves, gouging and kneeing and\ntripping were barred — and Allen re-\ntired.\n\n“They've made it a sissy sport,” he\nsaid. “I want no part of it.”\n\nHis daughter Mary, who also was\ncalled Polly, returned to the United\n\n\"States with him and she subsequently\nmarried Edward Taylor of St. Louis.\nThey are the grandparents of Thomas\nAllen Taylor, chairman of the Board of\nthe Seven Up Company, who has the\nfamed cup in his possession and who in\nhis spare time has tried to find out more\nabout his great grandfather without too\nmuch success.\n\nJust memories left\n\n“All I know is what I've read in old\nnewspaper accounts,’”’ says Tom Taylor,\n“‘plus some family memories.”\n\nWhen Allen died in 1903, it was as-\nsumed he left some money. After all, his\nsaloon had been prosperous, he had\nmade a fair amount of money selling\nwhiskey to the spectators who gathered\nfor the fights on the islands. In addition,\nthe side bets on several of the fights\n\nwere substantial, amounting in at least\none instance to $25,000.\n\nHis will left everything to his daugh-\nter, Polly Allen Taylor, and to a friend,\nTillie Hartgrove.\n\nWhen the will was submitted to pro-\nbate, however, it was discovered that he\n\n‘had gone the way of fighters up to this\n\nday. The will amounted to $278.35.\n\n“I have learned,” said Tom Taylor,\n“that the silver cup went to Miss Har-\ntgrove — but where it was from 1903\nwhen Tom Allen died until my father\nretrieved it from a Market Street pawn\nshop in 1938, I have no idea.”\n\nThere has been a story in the family,\ntoo, that Tom Allen came into possession\nof a diamond belt, emblematic of the\nworld championship. ‘‘Various of my\nrelatives have talked about it,” Taylor\nsaid, “but no one can verify that it ever\nexisted or where it is today.”\n\nHe plans to offer the silver cup, the\nlone remaining memento of his great\ngrandfather’s reign as champion, to the\nMissouri Historical Society.\n\nWorld of its own\n\nAs the foregoing suggests and as the\nfollowing substantiates, boxing always\nhas lived in a world all its own.
