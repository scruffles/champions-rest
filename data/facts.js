// good description of how people got to the fight on riverboat: 007
// a lot of good quotes in 047 and 069

// Tom and Jerry - https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2fd17j/til_tom_and_jerry_was_a_british_slang_term_from/
//   The original Tom and Jerry were characters in a story published by Pierce Egan, called Life in London or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, esq., and his elegant friend, Corinthian Tom. This story was later adapted into a play called Tom and Jerry, or Life in London. The titular characters apparently got drunk and fought and caused trouble a lot, and their names ended up becoming synonymous with fighting and troublemaking.
//   British were called Tommies and Germans, you guessed it, Jerries

// 106 reference to later bar as 'free and easy' suggests the name refers to a type of saloon and not the name of the bar

// in article 156, Allen trains Mitchell in a fight against Corbett.  Later a newspaper article is entitled Corbett's corner.. same guy? relation?

// letter from Allen about how modern fighters are "bum pugs" and "poor actors" 167

// good quotes in 203 by Tom Kelly

// detailed description of the bar in 209

// need to go back and get references from 266
