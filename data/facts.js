// Tom and Jerry - https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2fd17j/til_tom_and_jerry_was_a_british_slang_term_from/
//   The original Tom and Jerry were characters in a story published by Pierce Egan, called Life in London or, the Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn, esq., and his elegant friend, Corinthian Tom. This story was later adapted into a play called Tom and Jerry, or Life in London. The titular characters apparently got drunk and fought and caused trouble a lot, and their names ended up becoming synonymous with fighting and troublemaking.
//   British were called Tommies and Germans, you guessed it, Jerries
